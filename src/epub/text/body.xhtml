<h1>CHAPTER I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Lost Will</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a shame if all that money went
to the Tophams! They will fly higher than
ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew, a pretty girl of sixteen, leaned
over the library table and addressed her father
who sat reading a newspaper by the study
lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon, Nancy. What were
you saying about the Tophams?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew, a noted criminal and mystery-case
lawyer, known far and wide for his work
as a former district attorney, looked up from
his evening paper and smiled indulgently upon
his only daughter. Now, as he gave her his
respectful attention, he was not particularly
concerned with the Richard Topham family but
rather with the rich glow of the lamp upon
Nancy’s curly golden bob. Not at all the sort
of head which one expected to indulge in serious
thoughts, he told himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mischievously, Nancy reached over and
tweaked his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You weren’t paying a bit of attention,” she
accused him sternly. “I was saying I think
it’s mean if those snobbish Tophams fall heir
to all of Josiah Crowley’s fortune. Can’t
something be done about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Removing his horn-rimmed spectacles and
carefully folding the paper, Carson Drew regarded
his daughter meditatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid not, Nancy. A will is a will,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it does seem unfair that <span class='it'>all</span> the money
should go to them. Especially when they never
treated Josiah Crowley like a human being!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tophams were never noted for their
charitable dispositions,” Carson Drew observed,
with a smile. “However, they did give
Josiah a home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and everyone knows why! They
wanted to work him into leaving all his money
to them. And it seems that their scheme
worked, too! They treated him like a prince
until he made his will in their favor and then
they acted as though he were dirt under their
feet. Folks said he died just to be rid of their
everlasting nagging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tophams aren’t very well liked in our
little city, are they?” Mr. Drew commented
dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who could like them, father? Richard
Topham is an old skinflint who made his money
by gambling on the stock exchange. And Cora,
his wife, is nothing but a vapid social climber.
The two girls, Isabel and Ada, are even worse.
I went to school with them, and I never saw
such stuck-up creatures in all my life. If they
fall heir to any more money, this town won’t
be big enough to hold them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her estimate of the Topham family, Nancy
Drew did not exaggerate. Nearly everyone in
River Heights shared the opinion that the Tophams
were snobbish and arrogant, and the
treatment they accorded old Josiah Crowley
had aroused a great deal of unfavorable comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy had never known Josiah well, but
had often seen him on the street and secretly
had regarded him as a rather nice but
extremely queer sort of individual. His wife
had died during the influenza epidemic following
the World War, and since that time Crowley
had made his home with various relatives.
Although well-to-do, he preferred to “visit
around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, the Tophams had evidenced no interest
in the old man and he had been forced
to live with kindly relatives who were scarcely
able to have him with them. Crowley appreciated
the sacrifice and openly declared that
he intended to make his will in their favor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, three years before his death, the Topham
family experienced a sudden change of
heart. They begged Josiah Crowley to make
his home with them, and at last he consented.
Presently, rumor had it that the Tophams had
induced him to make his will in their favor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as time went on and Mr. Crowley, though
failing in health, maintained as firm a grip on
life as ever, the Tophams treated him unkindly.
Although he continued to live with them, it was
whispered about that frequently he slipped
away to visit his old friends and that he intended
to change his will again, cutting the
Tophams out entirely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then one day Josiah Crowley took to his
bed and did not get up. Just before his death
he attempted to communicate something to the
doctor who attended him, but his words were
unintelligible. After the funeral, only one will
came to light and, to the surprise of everyone,
it gave the entire fortune to the Tophams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, what do you suppose it was that
Mr. Crowley tried to tell the doctor just before
he died?” Nancy demanded, after a moment
of thought. “Do you imagine he was
trying to disclose something about his will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely, Nancy. Probably he intended
to leave his money to more deserving relatives.
But fate cheated him of the opportunity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But isn’t it possible that he did make such
a will and that he was trying to tell what he
had done with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s a possibility of course. Josiah
Crowley was rather queer in many ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he hid the will somewhere,” Nancy
suggested thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he did, I’m afraid it will never come to
light. The Tophams will see to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The estate is a considerable one, I understand,
Nancy, and the Tophams don’t intend
that anyone shall get a cent of it. It’s my
private opinion that they will take care that
a second will is never found.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that if they discovered the
will they would destroy it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m not making any accusations,
Nancy. But I do know that Richard Topham
is shrewd, and he isn’t noted for his honesty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t the present will be broken?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt it. While I haven’t gone into the
case, I am of the opinion that the Tophams
have a legal right to the fortune. It would
cost considerable to contest the will, and so far
as I know the other relatives are in poverty.
They have filed a claim, declaring that a later
will was made in their favor, but I doubt that
the matter will ever go further.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the Tophams don’t deserve the fortune,
father. It doesn’t seem fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t fair. But it is legal, and I’m
afraid nothing can be done about it. There
were two girls who live somewhere on the
River Road that were great pets of Crowley’s
when they were children. It seems to me that
they should have had something. And there
are a number of relatives who really deserve
a portion of the fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy nodded thoughtfully and relapsed
into silence while she digested the facts of the
case. From her father she had acquired the
habit of thinking things through to their logical
conclusion. Frequently, Carson Drew had
assured her that she went at a thing “like a
detective.” Certainly she had a naturally
clever mind and took more than an ordinary
interest in strange or baffling cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew, a widower, showered a great
deal of affection upon his daughter; it was his
secret boast that he had taught her to think
for herself and to think logically. Since he
knew that Nancy could be trusted with confidential
information, he frequently discussed
his interesting cases with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of times Nancy had been present
at interviews which her father had had with
noted detectives who desired his aid in solving
perplexing mysteries, and those occasions stood
out as red letter days for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something about a mystery which
aroused Nancy’s interest, and she was never
content until it was solved. More than once
her father had found her suggestions, or “intuitions”
as he called them, extremely helpful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a reason which she could not understand,
the Crowley case had attracted Nancy’s
attention, although it had not fallen into her
father’s hands. She had a certain feeling that
a mystery lurked behind it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, do you believe Josiah Crowley ever
made a second will?” Nancy demanded suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a regular lawyer, the way you
cross-examine me,” Carson Drew protested,
but with evident enjoyment. “To tell you the
truth, I don’t know whether he ever made a
second will or not. All I do know is that—but
perhaps I shouldn’t mention it since my
information is not very definite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on!” Nancy commanded impatiently.
“You’re trying to tease me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I do remember that one day nearly
a year ago I was standing in the First National
Bank when Crowley came in with Henry Rolsted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the attorney who specializes in wills
and legal documents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Well, as I was saying, they came into
the bank together. I had no intention of listening
to their conversation, but I couldn’t
help but hear that they were discussing a will.
Crowley made an appointment to call at Rolsted’s
office the following day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That looks as though Mr. Crowley had made
up his mind to write a new will, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was the thought which passed through
my mind at the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say you overheard the conversation
nearly a year ago,” Nancy mused. “That was
nearly two years after Mr. Crowley had made
the will in favor of the Tophams, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It’s likely Crowley had made up his
mind to change the will. I suspect he intended
to cut the Tophams out, but whether or not
he did, I have no way of knowing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Rolsted is an old friend of yours,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is. An old friend and an old college
classmate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why don’t you ask him if he ever
drew up a will for Mr. Crowley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a rather delicate question to ask,
young lady. He may tell me it’s none of my
business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know he won’t. You’re such a noted
attorney that other lawyers feel flattered when
you take an interest in their cases. Will you
do it? Please!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t promise to blunder into his office
and demand the information. Why this sudden
interest in the case, Nancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. A mystery always interests
me, I guess, and it does seem to me
that someone ought to help those poor relatives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take after your old dad, I am afraid.
But I’m curious to know what mystery you
have discovered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a will is missing, isn’t that a mystery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it is actually missing—yes. But it’s
possible that if Crowley ever wrote the will
he changed his mind and destroyed it. He was
subject to sudden whims, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow, I’d like to learn more about the
case if I can. Will you talk with Mr. Rolsted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are persistent, Nancy,” and Mr. Drew
smiled. “Well, I suppose I could invite him
to take luncheon with me to-morrow——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please do,” Nancy interrupted eagerly.
“That would be a splendid opportunity to find
out everything he knows about the will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll try to do it. But I warn you
not to expect startling news.” Carson Drew
glanced at his watch. “Why, it’s nearly midnight,
Nancy. We’ve been discussing this case
for over an hour. Better run off to bed now
and forget the Tophams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Nancy agreed somewhat reluctantly.
“Don’t forget your promise to-morrow
at luncheon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long after his daughter had retired, Carson
Drew sat by the fire. At last he, too, arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t surprise me if Nancy has
stumbled upon a real mystery,” he told himself,
as he snapped out the electric light and
turned toward the stairway. “Perhaps I
shouldn’t encourage her to dig into it, but
after all it’s in a good cause!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A Chance Meeting</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t forget your luncheon engagement
with Mr. Rolsted,” Nancy Drew reminded her
father the next morning at the breakfast table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll telephone him the first thing after I
reach my office,” Carson Drew promised.
“But again I warn you not to anticipate startling
news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t, father,” Nancy laughed. “But if
I should happen to learn something which has
a bearing on the missing will, I won’t be exactly
disappointed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are your plans for the day, Nancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing special. I thought I would
do a little shopping this morning. And I am
invited to a party one of the girls is giving
in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are too busy to take luncheon
with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, father, you know I’ve just been dying
for an invitation!” Nancy declared, her eyes
dancing. “I’m so anxious to learn something
about that will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, if you have time, drop in at my
office about twelve-thirty. Mr. Rolsted may
not accept my invitation, but if he does, we’ll
try to find out something about Josiah Crowley.
Of course I don’t need to warn you not
to appear too eager for information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll let you do all the talking,” Nancy told
him. “I’ll just keep my ears open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll look for you at twelve-thirty, then.”
Mr. Drew pushed back his chair and glanced at
his watch. “I must hurry now or I’ll be late
getting downtown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After her father had left, Nancy Drew finished
her breakfast and then went to the
kitchen to consult with Hannah, the maid, concerning
the work of the day. Although only
sixteen, Nancy was unusually capable, and
under her skillful direction everything ran
smoothly in the Drew household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the death of her mother six years before,
she had taken over the entire management of
the establishment. The Drews employed one
servant, Hannah Gruen, an elderly maid of all
work who had been with them for many years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The responsibility of the household might
have weighed heavily upon Nancy, but she was
the type of girl who is capable of accomplishing
a great many things in a comparatively
short length of time. She enjoyed sports of all
kinds and she found time for clubs and parties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In school Nancy had been very popular and
she boasted many friends. People declared
that she had a way of taking life very seriously
without impressing one as being the least bit
serious herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While at school Nancy had made one particular
chum, Helen Corning, of whom we
shall hear more later. She had also made two
enemies, the Topham sisters. Once she had
caught Ada in wrongdoing in class and both
sisters had placed the blame on Nancy. But
Helen and two others had come to Nancy’s
rescue. Since that time Ada and Isabel had
been more hateful to Nancy than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not be back for luncheon to-day,” Nancy
told Hannah, as she prepared to leave the
house. “I have made out the dinner menu and
ordered the groceries, so I guess you won’t
need me for a few hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the house, she went to the garage
where she kept her automobile. It was a shining
new blue roadster, the birthday gift of her
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly backing the automobile to the street,
she set off for the shopping district. She drove
swiftly down the boulevard, and upon reaching
the more congested streets, wormed her way
skillfully through heavy traffic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entering a department store, she made a
number of small purchases on the main floor
and then went directly to the wearing apparel
section, as it was her intention to purchase a
frock suitable for the afternoon party to which
she had been invited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Usually, Nancy found the service excellent,
but this morning was an especially busy one and
an extra rush of customers had temporarily
overwhelmed the sales force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not mind waiting her turn, but
quietly sat down in a convenient chair and
glanced about with interest. After a time her
attention was attracted toward two girls who,
like herself, were waiting for an available saleswoman,
but less patiently. Instantly, Nancy
recognized them as Ada and Isabel Topham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were remonstrating with the floor manager,
and their voices carried so far that she
could not help hearing what they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been standing here nearly ten minutes!”
Ada said petulantly. “Send a saleswoman
to us immediately!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I can’t,” the floor manager
said regretfully. “There are a number of
others ahead of you. An extra rush of customers——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you don’t know who we are!”
Ada interrupted rudely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I do,” the floor manager told her,
with a trace of weariness. “I will have a saleswoman
here in a few moments. If you will
only wait——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not accustomed to waiting,” Isabel
Topham told him icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such service!” Ada chimed in. “Do you
realize that my father owns stock in this store?
If we report your conduct to him, he could
have you discharged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” the harassed floor manager
apologized. “But it is a rule of the store.
You must await your turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ada tossed her head and her dark eyes flashed
angrily. In spite of the expensive clothes she
wore, she was anything but attractive, for she
was tall and slender to the point of being
termed “skinny.” Now that her face was distorted
with anger, she was positively ugly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel, who was the pride of the Topham
family, was rather pretty in a vapid sort of
way, but Nancy Drew thought that her face
lacked character. She had acquired an artificial
manner of speaking which was both irritating
and amusing. It was her mother’s
ambition that some day she marry into a
wealthy family, and every opportunity was
given her for a brilliant match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two sisters were older than Nancy, but
had been in her class at school. She had found
them stupid, as well as arrogant. They had
never been popular with their classmates and
had boasted few friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as they turned from the floor manager
and saw her for the first time, Nancy bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel coldly returned the bow but did not
speak a word of greeting. Ada gave no indication
that she had even noticed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Snobs!” Nancy told herself. “The next
time I won’t even bother to speak to them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment a saleswoman hurried toward
the Topham girls and at once they began to
shower abuse upon her for her failure to wait
upon them sooner. Nancy watched them curiously
as they examined the gowns which the
saleswoman brought out for their approval.
Evidently, Isabel and Ada were in an unpleasant
frame of mind, for they tossed aside beautiful
creations of lace and chiffon with scarcely
a second glance. They found fault with everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very chic gown,” the saleswoman told
them hopefully, as she displayed an attractive
dress. “It is a Paris model and arrived this
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ada picked it up, gave it one careless glance,
and then tossed it into a chair. The gown
slipped to the floor in a crumpled mass, and,
to the horror of the saleswoman, Ada stepped
on it as she turned to examine another dress.
In disgust, Nancy moved away and began to
examine a rack of dresses in another part
of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, as she wandered back, she saw
that Ada and Isabel were leaving without having
made a purchase. As they swept past, Ada
brushed against her. Instead of apologizing,
she wheeled and surveyed Nancy coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do watch where you are going!” she said
tartly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy stifled a sharp retort and made no
reply. Not without amusement she watched
the Topham sisters as they flounced to the
elevator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wonder that people say such mean
things about them,” Nancy told herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her thoughts were cut short as a saleswoman
offered her services. It was the same girl who
had waited upon the Topham sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy quickly selected a party frock of blue
crepe which matched her eyes, and went to the
fitting room to try it on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a real pleasure to serve you, Miss
Drew,” the saleswoman assured her when they
were alone. “But how I dread to see the Topham
sisters come into the store! They are so
unreasonable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ada and Isabel aren’t very popular,”
Nancy agreed. “They seem to think their
word is law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The saleswoman sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m afraid it will be if they get all
of Josiah Crowley’s money.” She lowered
her voice. “The estate hasn’t been settled, but
they’re counting on the fortune already. I
heard Miss Ada say to her sister: ‘Oh, I guess
we’ll get all of old Crowley’s fortune as soon
as the lawyers stop squabbling.’ But it’s my
opinion the Tophams are mightily worried for
fear somebody will show up with a later
will which may do them out of most of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy was far too wise to engage in gossip
with the saleswoman, for she could not tell how
far anything she might say would be carried.
But she was interested in the information. The
fact that the Tophams were worried indicated
to her that they were of the opinion that Josiah
Crowley had made a second will. Evidently,
they were somewhat disturbed by the claims of
the other relatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ordering the frock which she had purchased
sent to her home, Nancy glanced at her watch
and saw that it was after twelve o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must hurry or I’ll be late in meeting
father,” she thought, and left the store.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drove directly to her father’s office, and
although a few minutes ahead of the appointed
time, found that he was ready to leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What luck, father?” Nancy demanded eagerly,
when they were alone in the inner office.
“Did Mr. Rolsted promise to take luncheon
with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. We are to meet him at the Royal
Hotel in ten minutes. Do you still think I
should quiz him about the Crowley will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m more than ever interested in the
case, father. I can’t tell you why, but I just
seem to know that Josiah Crowley made a
second will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your intuitions are frequently correct,
Nancy,” Mr. Drew smiled. “So I’ll do
my best to find out what Mr. Rolsted knows
about the case. However, I must warn you not
to appear too eager for information, or he
may suspect we have a dark motive behind
the luncheon invitation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be careful,” Nancy laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Royal Hotel was located less than a
block away, and Nancy and her father quickly
walked the distance. As they entered the
lobby they found Mr. Rolsted there ahead of
them. Carson Drew introduced his daughter,
and the three made their way to the dining
room where a table had been reserved for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the conversation centered about a
variety of subjects. As the luncheon progressed
the two lawyers began to talk enthusiastically
of their college days together and finally of
their profession. Nancy began to fear that the
subject of the Crowley estate never would be
brought up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, over the coffee cups, Carson Drew
skillfully swung the conversation into a new
channel and began to discuss strange cases
which had fallen into his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, I haven’t heard the details of
the Crowley case. How are the Tophams making
out? I understand the relatives are trying
to break the will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Mr. Rolsted remained silent,
and Nancy began to think that he did not intend
to enter into a discussion of the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The case wasn’t turned over to me, Carson,”
the lawyer said quietly. “But I confess
I’ve followed it rather closely because of a
special interest I happen to have in Crowley.
As the present will stands, I do not believe it
can be broken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the Tophams will get the entire estate,”
Mr. Drew commented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, unless another will is uncovered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another will?” Carson Drew inquired innocently.
“Then you believe Crowley made
a second one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rolsted hesitated as though uncertain
whether or not he should divulge additional
information, and then with a quick glance
about, lowered his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, I wouldn’t want this to get out,”
he began doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may trust Nancy not to repeat,” Mr.
Drew observed, guessing what was in the lawyer’s
mind. “I’ve found that out by experience,”
and Carson Drew smiled upon his
daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I will say this much—it would not
surprise me if another will should come to
light. The Tophams treated Crowley most unkindly
after he had made his will in their favor.
About a year ago Crowley came to my office
and told me that he wanted to draw up a new
will. He indicated that he intended to cut the
Tophams off without a cent. He expressed a
desire to write the will himself, and asked me
a number of questions. I told him exactly how
to proceed. When he left my office he promised
that he would have me look over the document
when he had drawn it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you actually saw the will?” Mr. Drew
asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, strange to say, Crowley never came
back. I don’t know whether he drew up the
will or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if he did, there would be an excellent
chance that it would not be legal I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s a real trick to draw up a will that
cannot be broken. But Josiah Crowley was a
very careful man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, if he left even a loophole, the Tophams
would drag the matter into court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is a foregone conclusion that the
Tophams will keep the fortune whether they
have a right to it or not. They have the advantage
of money, you know. I believe the
other relatives have filed a claim, but they
have no proof a second will exists, and without
money they cannot hope to fight the Tophams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While her father and Mr. Rolsted discussed
the case, Nancy Drew remained silent, but not
a word of what was said escaped her. Although
she gave no indication of her feelings, the
information excited her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time, Mr. Drew paid the luncheon
check and the three arose and left the dining
room. Mr. Rolsted took leave of them in the
lobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Nancy, did you find out what you
wanted to know?” Carson Drew inquired after
the lawyer had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, father, it’s just as I suspected! Mr.
Crowley did make a second will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t jump hastily at conclusions,”
Mr. Drew warned her. “It’s possible that
Crowley never drew up the will at all, or if he
did, he may have destroyed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s possible, of course. But he had no
love for the Tophams, and I have a feeling he
hid the will someplace. Oh, if only I could
find it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be as easy as looking for a needle
in a haystack,” Mr. Drew replied. “If I were
you, I would forget about the case, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t forget about it until I’ve at least
made an attempt to find out what became of
that will,” Nancy insisted stubbornly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, dig into the mystery if you like,
but I’m afraid you’ve set yourself an impossible
task. I don’t see how you hope to discover
what became of the will when you haven’t
even a clue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll find a way!” Nancy laughed. “Give
me time and I’ll surprise you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after she had said good-bye to her father
and was slowly driving toward home, doubt
assailed her. She knew that the odds were
against her. Although she was determined
to find out what had become of the Crowley
will, she was at a loss to know how to begin.
As her father had reminded her, she did not
have a single clue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Where there’s a will, there’s a way,’ ”
she quoted whimsically. “That old proverb
is doubly true in the Crowley case. If there
actually is a second will, I’m going to find it!
And if I do, I hope it won’t prove to be in
the Tophams’ favor!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Racing the Storm</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy, if you haven’t planned anything
special for the day, I wonder if you would care
to do a little errand for me?” inquired Carson
Drew one morning at the breakfast table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course,” Nancy agreed pleasantly.
“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a number of legal documents which
must be delivered to Judge Hartgrave at Masonville
some time before noon. I would take
them myself, but I have several important appointments
this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be glad to do the errand for you,”
Nancy promised willingly. “I can run over to
Masonville in the Roadster. It isn’t more than
a fifteen mile jaunt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine. That’s a load off my mind. You’re
sure you don’t mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s such a wonderful day, I’ll enjoy the
trip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Drew parted the curtains at the dining-room
window and looked out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a bright day, but I can’t say I like
the appearance of those clouds in the west,
Nancy. I’m afraid it may rain. You know
how quickly our storms come up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll start just as soon as I can get ready
then. Where are the papers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the office. We can ride down together.”
Nancy Drew hurried away to find her hat
and purse. Before Mr. Drew had collected
his own belongings, she had backed the roadster
from the garage and was waiting for him, at
the curbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t heard you mention the Crowley
case lately,” Mr. Drew commented as they
rode along together. “Have you forgotten
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s face clouded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I haven’t forgotten, but I must admit
I have made no progress. I guess I’m not cut
out for a detective!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t feel discouraged, Nancy. The Crowley
case would baffle a professional.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t given it up yet, father. I may
stumble onto a clue one of these days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached the law office, Nancy
stopped the roadster and her father got out.
He disappeared inside the building and, returning
a few minutes later, placed a fat manilla
envelope in Nancy’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give this to Judge Hartgrave. You know
where to find him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ll have no trouble in finding his
office. I’ve frequently driven as far as Masonville.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Selecting the shortest route to her destination,
Nancy deftly shifted gears and was off.
As she rode along the gravel road her eyes
traveled to the fields on either side of the highway.
Like a true daughter of the Middle West,
Nancy Drew took pride in the fertility of her
State and saw beauty in a crop of waving
green corn as well as in the rolling hills and
the expanse of prairie land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than once Nancy glanced anxiously at
the sky. The sun shone down on the gravel
road with dazzling intensity, but a large black
cloud had settled in the west. Still, it did not
appear to be rolling up very fast, and Nancy
told herself that there was no need to worry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t rain for an hour or two, and by
that time I’ll be home,” she thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy took her time on the road and it was
nearly eleven o’clock when she finally drove
into Masonville. She went at once to Judge
Hartgrave’s office but was informed that he
had gone to the courthouse. Nancy knew that
the legal papers which she had been sent to
deliver were important, and rather than leave
them with the office girl she set off in search of
the judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had considerable trouble in finding him,
and it was nearly twelve o’clock when at last
she delivered the manilla envelope into his
hands. Learning that Nancy was the daughter
of Carson Drew, Judge Hartgrave insisted
that she take luncheon at his home before returning
to River Heights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy accepted the invitation and spent a
very pleasant hour in company with the judge
and his wife. When at last she had insisted
that she must start for home, it was after one-thirty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have half a notion to take a different
route back,” she told Judge Hartgrave, as she
stepped into her blue roadster. “It’s a beautiful
drive on the River Road. But the trip
will take longer, and I am afraid it may rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judge Hartgrave looked up at the sky, but,
in spite of a general murkiness, the sun was
shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t believe it will rain for an hour
or two,” he said optimistically. “That big
cloud is only bluffing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll take the River Road,” Nancy
decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said good-bye and started the motor.
Soon she was spinning along the road which
wound in and out along the Muskoka River.
Nancy met few automobiles, for the road was
infrequently traveled. She did not hurry, but
took time to enjoy the scenery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overhanging trees with dense foliage shaded
the road and formed a tunnel which all but
blotted out the sky. Presently, as Nancy drove
into a clearing, she was astonished to see how
dark it had become.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidently, the big black cloud which had
attracted her attention earlier in the day was
no longer bluffing. It had grown rapidly in
size and was spreading over the sky in an
alarming fashion. As Nancy Drew watched,
the sun vanished as though by magic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How foolish of me to take this road,” she
chided herself. “I’m going to be caught in
the storm! There isn’t a chance that I can
make it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the River Road was perfectly safe
in dry weather, Nancy knew that a little rain
would make it dangerously slippery. Then,
too, the road was little traveled, and in case of
accident she could not depend upon passing
motorists for aid. If her roadster slipped into
a ditch, it would be necessary to walk miles
for help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few persons lived along the River Road, for
the land was not considered valuable. In the
spring of the year, with the arrival of heavy
rains, the Muskoka River sometimes overflowed
its banks and spread over the farmland, destroying
the newly planted crops. For this
reason, the district was not a popular one and
the land was held by poor folk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only I can find a farmhouse where I can
drive in until the storm passes!” Nancy thought
desperately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sky was now entirely overcast and in
among the trees it was as dark as night. Nancy
could not see the road distinctly, and switched
on the headlights of her roadster. A brisk
breeze began to stir the trees, and the leaves
seemed to whisper a fearful warning of the
storm to come. A feeling of uneasiness took
possession of Nancy Drew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stepped on the accelerator and the roadster
fairly leaped forward as though it, too,
understood the need for haste. Suddenly, a
flash of forked lightning coursed across the
sky and was followed by a loud clap of thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was close!” Nancy murmured uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent low over the wheel and took the
curves as fast as she dared. An unexpected
gust of wind struck the road and blew dust in
every direction. As the cold air struck her,
Nancy realized that the storm was almost upon
her. Already, she could see the rain sweeping
down upon her from the far hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frantically, Nancy glanced about for a possible
shelter. On down the road a short distance,
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
she caught sight of an old farmhouse
and a dilapidated barn which stood near the
highway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only I can get there before the rain
strikes me!” Nancy thought anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the storm would hold off no longer.
Large drops of rain began to splash against
the windshield, slowly at first, then faster and
faster. The sky had taken on a yellowish cast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, unexpectedly, came a second flash of
lightning, and simultaneously a deluge of rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy turned on the windshield wiper, but
the rain was blinding in its violence. It was
impossible to see more than a few feet ahead
of the automobile, and almost in an instant the
road had dissolved into a sea of mud. Nancy
had been caught in a number of storms, but
never one like this. She feared that she would
slip into a ditch before she could reach the
shelter of the barn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, at the side of the road, the barn loomed
up, and in relief Nancy saw that the doors
were wide open. Without an instant’s hesitation,
she headed straight for the building and
drove in.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Safely inside, she turned off the motor and
the lights, and with a sigh of relief sank back
against the cushions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you got in just in time,” said a pleasant
voice behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Startled, Nancy Drew turned quickly and
saw a girl of her own age regarding her with
interest. Even as the stranger spoke, the storm
broke in full violence. A cold blast of wind
rattled the barn doors and sent a sheet of
rain inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon,” Nancy apologized, as
she climbed from the roadster. “It wasn’t
very polite of me to run in here the way I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re more than welcome to the shelter,
I am sure,” the stranger told her kindly. “I’m
afraid we haven’t much else to offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the semidarkness, Nancy studied the girl
curiously. She had been impressed with her
cultured voice and manner, and now she noted
that her clothing, while not expensive, was neat
and well made. The girl did not appear to be
the daughter of a farmer who would live on
this poor land, yet she seemed to fit into her
background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks to me as though we’re in for a
real storm,” the girl said and smiled pleasantly.
She glanced outside at the pelting rain.
“I’m afraid you’ll be forced to remain here
for some time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So long as I’m not out in the rain I don’t
mind,” Nancy replied quickly. “That is, if
you don’t object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Object?” The girl spoke impulsively.
“Oh, you can’t understand how eager we are
for visitors. Grace and I seldom have a chance
to talk with anyone our own age. Sometimes
a whole week will go by, and we won’t see anyone
but the postman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew had a natural talent for unearthing
interesting stories, and now a sixth
sense seemed to tell her that she had encountered
something unusual. She was eager to
learn more about the girl and her reason for
leading such an isolated life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must thank you for your hospitality,”
Nancy said, with a friendly smile. “After all,
perhaps the storm has done us both a real
favor in throwing us together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the moment, Nancy Drew little dreamed
that the next few hours were to reveal the
truth of her polite utterance.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>An Interesting Story</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“The storm is getting worse every minute,”
Nancy Drew’s companion observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy followed her to the barn door and
looked out. The rain was now coming down in
torrents, and as the girls stood in the doorway
a sudden gust of cold wind blew a sheet of
water into their faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let’s get back where it’s dry,” Nancy
laughed. “This is terrible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s getting cold, too,” her companion announced,
with chattering teeth. “Why not
come into the house with me? It’s far more
comfortable there. And unless I’m mistaken,
this storm will continue for an hour or so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like to trouble you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s no trouble at all. Grace will never
forgive me if I don’t bring you inside.” She
turned to Nancy with an apologetic smile. “I
guess I forgot to introduce myself. My name
is Allie—Allie Horner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I am Nancy Drew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the daughter of Carson Drew, the noted
lawyer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Nancy admitted, in surprise. “Do
you know my father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. But I guess everyone has heard
of him.” Allie Horner began to take off the
raincoat which she wore. “Here, take this.
And I’ll find you a pair of rubber boots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to take your raincoat,” Nancy
protested. “What will you wear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I have an old coat hanging here on a
nail. I’ll use that. Anyway, the rain won’t
hurt my dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under protest, Nancy donned the raincoat
and put on a pair of rubber boots which were
several sizes too large for her. She made such
a grotesque picture that the two girls could not
help but laugh. Then they closed the barn
doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” Allie directed. “Let’s make a dash
for it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hand in hand they splashed through the mud
toward the farmhouse. As they ran, a vivid
flash of lightning momentarily illuminated the
sky and caused the girls to cringe. The rain
pelted down steadily, and the atmosphere was
much colder than it had been ten minutes before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it gets any colder we’ll have hail,” Allie
chattered, as the two girls reached the shelter
of the porch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dropping their muddy boots outside, Allie
flung open the door, and they entered a warm
kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the door closed behind them, an older
girl who was bending over the kitchen range
turned toward them in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grace, I’ve brought you a visitor,” Allie
said quickly. “Miss Drew, I want you to meet
my sister. She’s the mainstay of our little
family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace Horner cordially acknowledged the
introduction and greeted Nancy with a warm
smile. She was tall and slender, as was her
sister, with dark hair and thoughtful brown
eyes. Nancy judged that she was at least four
years older than Allie. Her face was rather
serious, and it was evident that responsibility
had fallen upon her shoulders at an early age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy was at once attracted to both Grace
and Allie, and responded to their cordial welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s nice of you to take me in this way,”
she told them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy! It’s a pleasure for us,” Grace assured
her. “We don’t see a girl of our own
age once in a month unless we go to Masonville,
and our visits there aren’t very frequent,
Miss Drew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, please call me by my first name,” Nancy
begged. “Everyone does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three girls were soon laughing and talking
together as though they had always been
friends. Nancy knew that she was going to
like the Horner girls, and it was evident they
were delighted with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, Grace deftly removed a cake from
the oven and set it on the table to cool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go into the living room,” she suggested.
“My cake is done, so I don’t need to
watch it. I’ll give you a piece before you go,
Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Grace’s cakes are the real thing,” Allie
declared. “I’m not much of a cook myself.
I’d rather be outdoors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t wish you any bad luck, Nancy,”
Grace laughed as she led Nancy into the next
room. “But Allie and I don’t care how long
it storms!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither do I, so long as I get home before
dark,” Nancy replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the living room was warm and
comfortable, it was nearly bare of furniture.
The floors had been painted and were scantily
covered with handmade rag rugs. With the
exception of an old fashioned divan, an inexpensive
table, a few straight-back chairs, and
an old wood stove which furnished heat, there
was little in the room. However, dainty white
curtains covered the windows, and Nancy realized
that although the Horner girls were poor
they had tried hard to make their home attractive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely, you two girls don’t live here alone,
do you?” Nancy inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Allie nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grace and I have been living here ever since
father died. That was two years ago. Mother
passed away just before that,” the girl added
with a slight catch in her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how do you manage? It must be dreadfully
hard for two girls to run a farm by themselves,”
said Nancy, in wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our farm isn’t very large now,” Grace said
quietly. “We have only a few acres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you wonder how we live, but are
too polite to ask,” Allie broke in. “Grace helps
a dressmaker at Masonville whenever she can
get work. She makes all our clothes, too. And
I raise chickens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chickens?” Nancy asked, in surprise.
“Can you make much at that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it all depends. This year the market
hasn’t been so high as usual, and the price
of eggs has dropped, too. But I enjoy the
work, and I could make it pay if only I could
afford to start a flock of white leghorns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allie is a regular outdoor girl,” Grace explained,
with a smile. “We divide our work.
I attend to the house, but she would rather be
outside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We get along very nicely in the summer,”
Allie went on. “We raise vegetables and have
enough for our own use. But in the winter it’s
hard. I don’t know how we’ll manage this
year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll find a way, Allie,” Grace told her,
with a brave smile. “We always have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She arose from her chair and turned to
Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure you’re not interested in our misfortunes.
It’s true that we’re poor, but we
can still offer a guest a cup of tea. Excuse
me while I make it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the tip of Nancy’s tongue to protest,
but she checked the words just in time.
She knew that Allie and Grace were proud and
that to refuse their hospitality would hurt their
feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could help them,” Nancy thought.
“But if I offer to pay for the tea they will
be offended. Perhaps later on I can engage
Grace to make a dress for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes Grace returned to the living
room bearing a tray which had been covered
with a clean white napkin. She poured
the tea and served the cake with as much poise
as though she were gracing an elegant drawing
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never tasted more delicious cake in all
my life,” Nancy said warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three girls chattered over the tea cups
and watched the rain beat against the windows.
Presently, as Nancy noticed an unusual picture
on the wall, she commented on its beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Josiah gave it to us,” Allie told her.
“If he were only alive now, things would be
different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the mention of the name, Nancy started.
Could it be that Allie referred to Josiah Crowley?
It was very unlikely, she decided, yet only
the week before her father had told her that
there were two girls living on the River Road
who should have figured in the will. The relationship
would be worth investigating, Nancy
told herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then your uncle is dead?” she inquired
sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Josiah Crowley wasn’t really our uncle,”
Grace replied. “But we loved him as much as
though he were a relative.” Her voice broke
and for a moment she could not go on. “He
lived next door to us—that was when mother
and father were alive. All of our misfortunes
seemed to come at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was the dearest man you ever saw,”
Allie added, taking up the story. “Some people
thought him queer, but you never minded
his peculiar ways after you knew him. He was
so good and kind to us. We were neighbors
for years—until the Tophams induced him to
live with them. After that, everything was
changed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he never liked it with the Tophams,”
Grace declared. “They weren’t kind to him,
and he used to sneak off to visit us. Didn’t
he, Allie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he often said that we seemed like his
own children. He brought us so many nice
gifts. We loved him for himself and not his
money, but after our parents died he hinted
that he intended to see to it that we never
came to want. I remember the very last day
we ever saw him alive, he told us that he intended
to mention us in the will. ‘I have
planned a big surprise for you girls. You’ll
see it in my will.’ Those were his very words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then the Tophams got everything,”
Grace said somewhat bitterly. “It isn’t that
we were expecting any of the money, but it
does seem unfair that the entire fortune should
go to them. They never cared a snap of their
fingers for Uncle Josiah, and I don’t believe he
intended to leave his money to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you were mentioned in the will
they say can’t be found,” Nancy suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace and Allie exchanged significant glances
and gravely nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what we think,” Allie announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t something be done about it? It
seems only fair that you should have your
inheritance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid there’s nothing we can do,”
Grace said doubtfully. “You see, although we
are certain a will was made in our favor, we
have no actual proof. We haven’t enough
money to fight the case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tophams ought to do something for
you girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tophams?” Allie laughed scornfully.
“They wouldn’t give us a cent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time Allie and Grace Horner talked
of Josiah Crowley and his queer ways. To
Nancy it was evident that the girls had loved
the old man a great deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, as the rain ceased and the sun
threatened to break through the clouds, Nancy
arose to leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your story has interested me a great deal,”
she assured the Horner girls. “It’s possible
my father can do something to help you—he
is a lawyer you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we weren’t asking for help!” Grace
interposed quickly. “I don’t know why we
happened to tell you so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad that you did, and if I can I want
to help you. If my father asks you to come
to his office in River Heights will you do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, I suppose so,” Grace admitted
slowly. “But we have told you about everything
we know concerning the will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father is a wonder at unearthing hidden
facts,” Nancy declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s kind of you to tell your father about
our case,” Allie broke in. “We’d be so grateful
if something could be done. We don’t want
a cent that doesn’t belong to us, but it does
seem as though we should have received a
small inheritance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t build up your hopes until after I’ve
talked with my father,” Nancy advised them
as she turned toward the door. “If anything
can be done I promise I’ll let you know.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A Conference</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Although the rain was no longer falling,
the River Road was a sea of mud, and before
Nancy Drew started for home, the Horner girls
insisted on helping her put chains on the rear
wheels of the roadster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll never make it to the gravel unless
you do,” Grace advised her. “The River Road
is terribly slippery in wet weather. You’re
sure you want to attempt it? We’d love to
have you stay with us until to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll have only two miles to go before
I strike gravel,” Nancy returned. “I’ll make
it all right. But before I go I do wish you
would let me pay for all the trouble I have
caused you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We couldn’t think of accepting money,”
Grace said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s been fun having you here,” Allie added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, after thanking the Horner sisters
for their hospitality, Nancy told them good-bye.
Allie and Grace watched her until she
had backed the Roadster from the barn and
was safely on the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re taking a big chance in this mud,”
called out Allie after her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you have any trouble, come back here,”
added Grace. “That is, if you can get back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t skid into a tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or into a ditch—that would be worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you trying to do, make me nervous?”
demanded Nancy, but with a smile on
her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; we only want to see you get home
safely,” answered Grace, and by that time the
car was so far on its way no more could be said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once on her way Nancy had little trouble,
for she was a skillful driver. The mud was
heavy, but although the roadster slipped about
she managed to keep it in the road. Nevertheless,
she was relieved when at last she reached
the main graveled highway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll stop at father’s office,” she decided, as
she drove into River Heights. “I want to tell
him about my adventure right away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She parked the car and surveyed it rather
ruefully as she climbed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor thing needs a bath! But even if I
did get into mud, it was worth it. Otherwise
I would never have found out about the Horner
girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy was admitted to her father’s private
office, he arose from his chair to greet her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you’re here safe and sound,” he
declared, in relief. “I’ve been worried ever
since that storm came up. I telephoned the
house and Hannah said you weren’t back. It
gave me a bad scare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a little adventure,” Nancy announced,
with an important air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly, she told of her meeting with the
Horner sisters and what she had learned concerning
the Crowley will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allie and Grace Horner are as poor as
church mice, but they’re proud, too,” Nancy
ended. “If only we could do something to
help them! They deserve a portion of the
Crowley estate, but they’ll never get it unless
someone takes a hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From what you say it looks as though Crowley
really did make a will in their favor,” Carson
Drew commented thoughtfully. “I never
had any particular liking for Richard Topham,
and I’ll admit it would please me to see him
lose the money. I’ll be glad to do anything I
can to help the Horner girls, Nancy. We
might invite them to the house for a little conference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was hoping you would suggest that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say the girls have no idea what became
of the will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They never saw it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is possible that by talking with them
we may learn something which may serve as
a clue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll invite them to the house to-morrow if
you want me to,” Nancy said quickly. “You’re
so clever at asking questions, and the Horner
girls will do anything in their power to help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Drew studied his desk calendar for a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. But make it day after to-morrow
afternoon at three. I have no appointment
for that hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that she had accomplished her purpose,
Nancy gave her father a hug and fairly danced
toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you’d try to help them,” she called
back over her shoulder. “Now that you’ve
promised, I’ll scamper off and let you get your
work done!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s interest in the Crowley case had
intensified since her chance meeting with the
Horner girls, and it was with impatience that
she awaited the conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the day of the appointment she kept
watching the clock, wondering if Allie and
Grace would keep the engagement. She had
sent them the invitation and they had promised
to come, but Nancy was a trifle uneasy, especially
as the hour of three approached and the
two girls had not arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why they don’t come,” she
fretted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were scarcely out of her mouth
when the doorbell jangled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That must be the girls now,” she cried, as
she hurried to open the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was indeed Allie and Grace Horner.
Nancy greeted them enthusiastically and, ushering
them into the comfortable study, introduced
her father. At first the Horner sisters
were rather ill at ease, but after a few minutes
they relaxed and began to talk frankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about Josiah Crowley,” Carson
Drew suggested. “I understand that he was
rather a peculiar man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he was,” Allie began impulsively.
“I’ve seen him go about hunting for his spectacles
when they were on his nose all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he ever hide things?” Mr. Drew inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he?” Allie laughed. “He was always
putting things away in what he called a safe
place. The place was usually so safe that he
could never find it again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he ever say anything which would lead
you to believe that he had hidden a will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Allie shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that I can remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he did, too!” Grace broke in. “One
day when he was at our house he got to talking
about the Tophams and the way they were
trying to get his money. ‘I guess they’ll be
fooled all right when they find out I’ve made
another will,’ he said with that odd little
chuckle of his. ‘This time I’m not going to
trust it to any lawyer. I’ll put it away in a
place that I know will be safe.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” Allie agreed. “I had forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was Crowley living with the Tophams at
the time he told you this?” Carson Drew asked
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it possible that he hid the
will somewhere in the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean at the Tophams?” Grace inquired.
“Of course I have no way of knowing,
but it’s my opinion that he did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy and her father exchanged quick
glances as the same thought occurred to them.
Perhaps the Tophams had discovered the will
and already had destroyed it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew asked a few more questions.
The Horner girls were eager to help, but they
were unable to furnish additional information
which had a direct bearing on the missing will.
After Nancy had served tea, they thanked Carson
Drew for his interest in them, and arose
to depart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I find that I am able to help you in any
way, I will do so,” Mr. Drew told the sisters
as he escorted them to the door. “And of
course there will be no charge for my services.
However, unless the will is found there is really
very little that can be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Allie and Grace had left, Nancy turned
inquiring eyes upon her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charming girls,” he commented, “and undoubtedly
deserving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll help them?” Nancy demanded
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid there is nothing I can do,
Nancy,” Mr. Drew returned regretfully. “The
will is probably lost forever. It wouldn’t surprise
me if it had been destroyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean—the Tophams?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same thought came to me,” Nancy declared.
“It would be just like them to destroy
it if it fell into their hands! They have no
scruples whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course we have no proof the Tophams
did away with the will, Nancy. It would be
very unwise to suggest such a thing to the Horner
girls. They deserve a portion of the estate,
but without the will nothing can be done. If
they took the matter to court they wouldn’t
have a chance to win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’re right,” Nancy admitted
unwillingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while she dropped the subject for the
time being, Nancy Drew did not forget the Horner
sisters. She continued to hope that by
some queer twist of fate they would come into
their rightful inheritance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the will has been destroyed I don’t see
how anyone can help them,” she told herself
rather unhappily. “But until I’m sure of it,
I’m not going to give up!” She squared her
shoulders with determination. “I’ll find some
way to discover what became of the will!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>An Unpleasant Encounter</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of Nancy Drew’s firm decision to
assist the Horner girls, the days slipped by
and, try as she would, she could think of no
way to discover whether or not the missing
Crowley will had fallen into the hands of the
Tophams. Although she seldom discussed the
case with her father, he knew that she was
troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re worrying about the Horner girls,”
he observed one day. “I am afraid you are
taking their misfortunes too seriously. There
is nothing you can do without the will, and you
had best forget about it. Why, you’ve scarcely
been out of the house since the Horner girls
were here. Go shopping, or anything, to take
your mind from the subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been thinking about Allie and
Grace,” Nancy admitted, with a rueful smile.
“I was so sure I could do something for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give your mind a rest and perhaps you’ll
have an inspiration,” Mr. Drew encouraged
her kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll take your advice and go
shopping, though I really haven’t a thing to
buy. The fresh air will do me good, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After luncheon, Nancy left the house and
made her way toward the business section of
River Heights. The walk was a long one, but
she took it at a brisk pace. Nancy naturally
was athletic, and as she swung along more
than one passerby turned to look after her in
admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After “window shopping” for a time, she
wandered into a department store more from
curiosity than because she had anything to
buy. She moved about aimlessly, gazing at
whatever struck her fancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Nancy’s attention centered upon
two girls who were hurrying down the aisle
ahead of her. She stopped short and stared.
Though their backs were turned, she had recognized
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ada and Isabel Topham! I’m sure I don’t
want to tag them around! I’ll just slip down
another aisle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nancy Drew never carried the thought
into action, for at that very moment she saw
Ada brush carelessly against a counter of expensive
vases. As her sleeve caught, a large
fragile bowl was swept to the floor. In horror
Nancy heard the crash and saw the bowl break
into a dozen pieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Ada looked down upon the wreckage, a
slight flush mounted to her cheeks. Then with
a toss of her head, she started to move on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss, I am afraid I must ask you to pay
for the bowl,” a saleswoman interposed politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ada wheeled angrily and stared at the saleswoman
insolently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not pay for it!” she snapped. “I
didn’t break it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Miss, I saw you knock it off the counter,”
the saleswoman protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the floor manager had arrived
upon the scene, and a number of shoppers had
gathered about Ada and the salesgirl. Nancy
likewise drew closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This impudent girl claims I broke a vase,”
Ada stormed, addressing the floor manager.
“I wasn’t even near the counter at the time!
However, I did see her knock it to the floor
herself. Isn’t that so, Isabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Solemnly, Isabel agreed to the untruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The floor manager looked doubtfully from
the Topham sisters to the saleswoman. He
realized that it would be a serious error to
accuse well-to-do customers falsely, and for
that reason he was inclined to give the Topham
girls the benefit of the doubt. He stooped
over and examined the fragments of the bowl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Someone must pay for the damage,” he
said severely. “This is an expensive imported
bowl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let your clerk pay for it out of her
salary,” Ada retorted. “If she hadn’t been so
stupid she wouldn’t have broken the vase!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The saleswoman was too bewildered to take
her own part and Nancy saw that the floor
manager was in a dilemma. As she sensed
that he was about to exonerate Ada from all
blame, she stepped forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be mistaken, Miss Topham,” she
said quietly. “I am certain the saleswoman
did not break the bowl, for I saw the accident
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What business have you to interfere?” Ada
demanded harshly, wheeling upon Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it isn’t my business, but I can’t
permit you to accuse this girl of something
she didn’t do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw the accident, Miss?” the floor
manager questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. As Miss Topham walked by the counter,
her sleeve caught on the vase.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t true,” Ada snapped. “But I’m
tired of this silly argument. How much do
you want for your vase?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The floor manager studied a price list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” Ada fairly screamed. “You want
fifty dollars for that old bowl? I’ll never
pay it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The vase was imported from Italy, Miss,
and I am afraid you must pay the price asked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know who I am?” Ada inquired
loftily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think everyone in the city knows about
the Richard Tophams,” the floor manager returned
wearily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father owns——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t own this store,” the man interrupted,
with growing impatience. “If you
refuse to pay for the vase I shall be forced
to turn you over to the authorities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t dare!” Ada gasped. “Never
in all my life have I been insulted like this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel, who was slightly more reasonable
than her sister, now held a whispered conference
with Ada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll pay for the bowl,” Ada decided,
as she took out her checkbook. “But
let me warn you the matter won’t be dropped
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned upon Nancy Drew and eyed her
coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not through with you either, young
lady! You’ll pay for this outrage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy made no reply but continued to smile
pleasantly, an act which further enraged the
Topham sisters. Hastily settling for the damage
Ada had done, they sailed grandly out
of the store.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gratefully, the saleswoman thanked Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know how I appreciated the way
you took my part. I couldn’t have paid for
the bowl, and if you hadn’t said what you did
the floor manager probably would have discharged
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw her break the bowl and I was determined
to see justice done. There is my
name and address—if you need it,” and Nancy
handed the woman her card.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you have made enemies by taking
my part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shrugged her shoulders indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It really doesn’t matter. The Topham girls
were never my friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they may try to get even with you.
They’re very spiteful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them try!” Nancy smiled. “However,
I don’t believe there is any need to worry.
Their talk is mostly bluff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lightly, Nancy Drew dismissed the subject,
and, as she found she was being regarded with
curiosity and admiration by those who had
witnessed the scene, left the store. She walked
slowly toward the park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It makes my blood fairly boil every time I
think of Ada and Isabel Topham getting all of
the Crowley fortune,” she told herself, with
feeling. “Especially when Grace and Allie
Horner need the money so badly. The way
Ada tried to accuse that shopgirl was disgusting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy crossed the public park and paused
for a moment at the drinking fountain. As
she glanced up she saw that unwittingly she
had selected the path Isabel and Ada Topham
had taken. Upon leaving the department store
they, too, had gone to the park and were now
seated upon a bench engaged in earnest conversation.
Their heads were close together,
and, from the expression on their faces, Nancy
suspected that they were discussing her. Unless
she retraced her steps it would be necessary
to pass directly in front of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they see me they are certain to say something
mean,” Nancy thought, “and if they do
I’ll be sure to lose my temper. I know!” she
decided impulsively. “I’ll take the path
through the bushes and avoid them. I can pass
behind that bench and they’ll never notice me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ada and Isabel were so engrossed in their
conversation that they failed to notice Nancy’s
approach. Chuckling to herself, Nancy left
the sidewalk and quietly made her way down
the path which was shaded with overhanging
bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had no intention of attempting to overhear
what the Topham sisters were saying, but
as she noiselessly approached the bench where
they were sitting, two words reached her ears,
causing her to pause involuntarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ada was speaking, and the phrase which
Nancy had accidently overheard was “the
will.” In a flash, her suspicions were aroused.
She comprehended the significance of the
phrase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be Josiah Crowley’s will they’re
talking about,” she reasoned. “Perhaps they
know something about the missing will! They
may reveal what became of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the instinct of a detective, Nancy Drew
crept cautiously closer. The bushes were thick,
and by crouching low behind the bench she was
able to hear without being seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, if only she might learn something which
would prove that the Tophams had deprived
the Horner girls of their inheritance!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Nancy Turns Sleuth</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>While Nancy Drew eagerly waited, scarcely
daring to breathe naturally lest her presence
be detected, Ada began to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if there should happen to be another
will, we may be dumped,” she said sourly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe Josiah Crowley ever made
such a will,” Isabel replied, in so low a tone
that Nancy scarcely caught the words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evidently Nancy Drew does, or she
wouldn’t be taking such an interest in those
Horner girls,” Ada returned. “I know she had
them at her house last week, because I was
passing and saw them go in. How I hate that
girl! If she should get her father interested,
he might dig up another will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even if another will does turn up, we can
trust dad to take care of it,” Isabel commented
dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean he would——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind what I mean,” Isabel insinuated
darkly. “Mother and dad wouldn’t be
simple enough to let that money get away from
us. It’s ours by right, anyhow. Didn’t Josiah
Crowley live on us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we ought to have all of the money
after enduring him for nearly three years.
Just the same, I don’t like the way Nancy
Drew has taken up with the Horner girls. She
always did have a way of nosing into things
she had no business to find out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, pooh for her,” Isabel scoffed. “Let
her try to discover anything she likes. The
money was given to us fairly enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation ended abruptly as Isabel
and Ada arose from the bench and walked on
down the street. Nancy waited until they were
out of sight and then emerged from the bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There may be a chance to find that missing
will after all,” she reasoned, as she sank down
on the bench vacated by Isabel and Ada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy had always been convinced that Josiah
Crowley had made a second will. However,
since her talk with the Horner girls, she had
shared her father’s opinion that the document
had fallen into the hands of the Tophams only
to be destroyed. This conviction had discouraged
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the information which she had gleaned
from the snatch of overhead conversation,
gave her new hope. From what Isabel and Ada
had said, she was led to believe that if Josiah
Crowley had made a second will, the Tophams
were as ignorant as herself concerning its
whereabouts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway, it’s encouraging to know the will
hasn’t been destroyed,” Nancy told herself.
“But there’s one thing certain. If the Tophams
ever get their hands on it, they’ll take
care it never comes to light. From what Isabel
and Ada said I judge they’re beginning to
realize their position is anything but secure.
If I’m ever to find that will, I must get busy
before they beat me to it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew possessed her father’s liking
for a mystery, and she delighted in a battle of
wits when championing a worthy cause. Carson
Drew had often remarked that he enjoyed
the detective work of his cases better than the
court work, but Nancy knew he was too busy
with his own cases to devote much attention
to the missing Crowley will. If anything were
done to help the Horner girls win their inheritance,
she must accomplish it herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy reviewed the facts of the case, it
seemed to her that she must have overlooked a
possible clue. Never had a mystery appeared
more baffling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For nearly ten minutes Nancy sat lost in
deep thought. Then, with a cry of delight she
sprang to her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How stupid of me not to think of it before!
The Horner girls aren’t the only ones who
should have figured in the will. There were a
number of relatives, and father said that they
filed a claim, too. I wonder who they are. If
I could talk with them, it’s possible I might
learn something that would have a bearing on
the case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Convinced that the inspiration was a happy
one, she set off toward her father’s office. He
was engaged in an important conference when
she arrived, and Nancy was forced to wait ten
minutes before she was admitted to the inner
office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what?” her father asked, smiling as
she burst in upon him. “Is it a new dress you
want!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s cheeks were flushed and her eyes
danced with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t try to tease me,” she protested.
“I’ve stumbled onto something important, and
I want information!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At your service, Nancy,” Mr. Drew said.
“But if it’s about that Crowley case, I’ve told
you everything I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy poured out the story of her encounter
with the Topham sisters in the department
store and told of the conversation she had overheard
in the public park. Mr. Drew listened
with interest until she had finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now what is it you want?” he asked
gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought if I went to those other relatives
I might be able to learn something which may
help solve the mystery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good idea, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t know their names, and that’s
why I came to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could help you, but I’m afraid I
can’t,” Mr. Drew said regretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s face fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute!” he called, as she turned to
leave. “I can’t supply the names you want,
but I think I can tell you where to find them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the courthouse. They should be on file.”
He glanced at his watch and frowned. “But
I’m afraid it is too late to go there this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, and I’m anxious to find out right
away,” Nancy declared in disappointment.
“If I delay even a single day the Tophams
may get ahead of me and find that will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly her face brightened as she thought
of something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know! I’ll jump into the roadster and
run out and have a talk with the Horner girls.
They should be able to furnish me the information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can try them, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what I’ll do,” Nancy decided,
as she turned again toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute,” Carson Drew stopped her.
“I wonder if you realize just what you are
getting into, Nancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only this. Detective work isn’t always
the safest occupation in which to engage. I
happen to know that Richard Topham is an
unpleasant man when crossed. If you actually
succeed in learning anything which may help
the Horner girls, you are certain to have the
Tophams in your wool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not afraid of them, father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” Mr. Drew exclaimed. “I was
hoping you would say that. I’m glad you have
the courage of your convictions, but I didn’t
want you to march off into battle without a
knowledge of what, undoubtedly, you will be up
against.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Battle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, battle. Rest assured the Tophams
won’t give up the fortune without a bitter
struggle. However, if they attempt to make
serious trouble, I promise to deal with them
myself. I only wish I had the time to help
you find the will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I find it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take the matter into court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you! There’s no one like you in
all the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy moved toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may not get back until rather late,” she
threw back over her shoulder. “I have a feeling
I may discover a real clue to-day, and if I
do, I’m going to trail it down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With characteristic impetuosity, she darted
from the room, permitting the office door to
bang behind her.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A Discouraging Day</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>After leaving her father’s office, Nancy
Drew went directly home. Quickly backing
her roadster from the garage, she set off down
the River Road in the direction of the old
farmhouse where the Horner girls lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before leaving the main highway, Nancy
glanced anxiously at the sky and was relieved
that no clouds were visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After my last experience, I don’t intend
to get caught in another storm,” she admonished
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The recent rain had made the roads rough,
and Nancy bumped about in the roadster rather
uncomfortably. At last, however, she came
within sight of the farmhouse, and as she
viewed it from a distance noticed that it was
even older and more run-down than she had
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house was large and rambling, but apparently
it had not been painted in years.
Shingles were falling from the roof, and the
porches sagged. As Nancy’s eyes traveled to
the old barn, she wondered how it had managed
to survive the recent storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Allie and Grace Horner only had money,
they could make the place attractive,” she
thought as she drove through the open gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Squawking chickens fled before her as she
stopped the roadster in the barnyard and
switched off the engine. Springing lightly
from the car, she ran up the walk toward the
house. She paused at the kitchen door and
rapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Receiving no response, she went around to
the front of the house and knocked on another
door. There was no answer. Nor did a tour
of the yard reveal either of the Horner girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Disappointment took possession of Nancy.
She had driven nearly fifteen miles only to
find no one at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m defeated at every turn,” she thought
disconsolately, as she slowly walked back to
the roadster. “It’s certainly discouraging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, there!” a voice called. “Were you
looking for us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shouted greeting reached Nancy as she
prepared to step into the roadster. One foot
on the running board, she turned her head
and saw the Horner girls hurrying toward her
from the direction of the barn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Allie did not wait for her sister to open the
barnyard gate, but, swinging easily over it, ran
to meet Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We saw you just as you were leaving the
house,” she cried enthusiastically. “We
wouldn’t have missed you for anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were picking berries in the woods,”
Grace explained, as she hurried up, slightly out
of breath. Proudly she displayed a tin pail
which was filled nearly to the brim with raspberries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But look at our arms!” and Allie laughed
ruefully as she glanced down at the ugly
scratches which had been caused by brambles
and sharp thorns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must come into the house and have
a dish of berries, Nancy,” Grace urged hospitably.
“They’re good with sugar and cream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you don’t have them too often,” Allie
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can stop but a minute,” Nancy declared,
as the three entered the house. “I came to
talk about the will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, then you have good news for us?”
Allie asked hopefully. “Are we really going
to get some of the money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know yet,” Nancy was forced to
admit. “So far I haven’t been able to learn
a thing about the missing will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Allie’s face fell, but she tried to hide her
disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We need the money so badly,” she said,
with an apologetic smile. “Grace hasn’t had a
new dress in three years. She makes all of
our clothing out of old things we happen to
have in the house. If our luck doesn’t change
soon I’m afraid we’ll be mistaken for rag
pickers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We really didn’t expect much of Uncle
Josiah’s money,” Grace broke in quickly, lest
Nancy misinterpret her sister’s remarks. “We
weren’t related, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can hardly say the Tophams
were, for that matter,” Allie declared. “They
were third or fourth cousins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can get along without the money,”
Grace said quietly. “We manage very well
when I have plenty of work. We’re a little
discouraged right now because dressmaking
has fallen off. It’s a slack season, I guess
people would rather go to the store and buy
a dress readymade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t,” Nancy declared impulsively.
“Grace, I’d like to engage you to make me a
dress. Will you do it? I’ll pay you well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears of joy came into Grace’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will I? Oh, you don’t know how grateful
I am for the work. I haven’t had anything
to do for nearly three months. I don’t mind
poverty so much for myself, but for Allie—”
her voice broke. “I promised mother I’d look
after her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Allie sprang from her chair and rushed to
her sister. She flung her arms affectionately
about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Grace, I shouldn’t have said what I
did about needing money. I didn’t mean it!
Truly, I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll get along, Grace. If only my chicken
money came in faster! Why can’t a hen lay
more than one egg a day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace smiled faintly at Allie’s feeble attempt
at a joke, and, to break an awkward silence,
Nancy took up the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bring the dress material with me the
next time I come this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not need a new dress, but she realized
that there was no other way to help the
Horner girls, for they were too proud to accept
money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now I want to ask you a few more
questions about Josiah Crowley,” Nancy told
them. “Do you know whether he ever visited
other relatives besides the Tophams?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” Allie returned promptly. “He
was only distantly related to the Tophams, you
know. They were third cousins I believe. He
had a number of other relatives whom he frequently
visited.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before he went to live with the Tophams,
they took turns keeping him,” Grace informed
her visitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you tell me the names of these
relatives?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see,” Grace lost herself in thought.
“There are two cousins living in Masonville.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Matilda and Edna Turner,” Allie prompted
her. “They’re regular old maids, but awfully
nice. They were wonderful to Uncle Josiah
when he was alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there were two nephews,” Grace went
on. “William and Fred Mathews. They have
a farm on this same River Road. Everyone
thought they would get something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far do they live from here?” Nancy
inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not more than five miles. You could
drive there in a few minutes. It’s on the way
to Masonville.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll be able to make the two calls on
the same trip,” Nancy announced, as she arose
to depart. “I must hurry along now or it will
be too late for me to stop there this afternoon.
I am hoping that by talking with the relatives
I may learn something which will help us to
trace the missing will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid there’s not much chance we’ll
ever get anything,” Grace said rather morosely.
“The Tophams will never let the money slip
out of their hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we find the will, they won’t be able to
keep the money,” Nancy declared. “Father
will see to it that you girls get your just due.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Grace, we forgot to tell Nancy about
Abigail Rowen,” Allie reminded her sister.
“She’d be apt to know more about the will
than anyone else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right! You really should call on
her, Nancy. She took care of Uncle Josiah
one time when he was sick, and he thought
the world of her. He often declared he intended
to leave her something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even a few hundred dollars would have
meant so much to her,” Allie added. “Abigail
is old and feeble now. She must be more than
seventy years of age, and there’s no one to
look after her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall I find her?” Nancy asked
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She lives over on the West Lake Road,”
Grace responded. “It’s a good many miles
from here. You could make inquiry at some of
the farmhouses along the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t have time to go there to-day, but
I’ll surely call upon her as soon as I can. And
now I must be going or it will be dark long
before I get back to River Heights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy said good-bye hastily. The Horner
girls accompanied her to the roadster and
watched her drive away. As she looked back
from the corner, they waved their handkerchiefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plucky girls!” Nancy thought. “Until
to-day I didn’t realize how terribly they need
help. I simply must find a way to help them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drove along the River Road, heading
in the direction of Masonville. Although it
was growing late, Nancy was determined to
visit the Mathews brothers, and, if possible,
Matilda and Edna Turner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After she had gone perhaps five miles, she
began to watch the mailboxes, and presently
noticed one which bore the name “Mathews.”
The farmhouse was set back a short distance
from the road, and Nancy drove the roadster
down a narrow lane which led to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she stopped the car, a man came out
of the house and regarded her questioningly.
Learning that the farmer was William
Mathews, Nancy quickly explained her
mission. At first the man was inclined to distrust
her, but after he had made certain that
she was not a friend of the Richard Topham
family, he talked frankly of Josiah Crowley
and told all that he knew concerning the will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brother and I have filed a complaint
with the proper authorities at the courthouse,”
he explained. “We feel certain there must
have been another will because Uncle Josiah
always said that he intended to leave us something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you actually see the will?” Nancy questioned
hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farmer shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my brother and I haven’t the proof
that he ever made a second will. But we do
know that he never had any particular love for
the Tophams. He felt that they took him in
only because they were after his money, and
I guess he wasn’t wrong at that. Anyway, I
am certain he had made up his mind to cut
them off without a cent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he neglected to write the second
will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That wouldn’t be like Uncle Josiah. He
was rather queer about little things, but he
was always particular in attending to business
matters. No, I’m more apt to think he made
the will and hid it somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have no idea where he could have
concealed it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the slightest, Miss. My brother and I
will be glad to offer a substantial reward to
anyone who can produce it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy asked a number of other questions,
but the farmer was unable to furnish information
which was of any value. Disappointed,
she thanked the man for his trouble, and continued
on her way to Masonville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rumor! Rumor!” she sighed. “That’s all
I hear. At my next stop I hope I’ll acquire a
few facts!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon reaching Masonville, Nancy made inquiry
and was directed to the home of the
Turner sisters. They lived alone at the outskirts
of the city. Although not in poverty,
they did not have any more money than they
needed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy found them at home, and when they
learned the purpose of her visit they greeted
her cordially. They were very pleasant ladies
and she spent nearly an hour at their home.
But although they answered her questions willingly,
she learned nothing which had a direct
bearing on the missing will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matilda and Edna Turner insisted that
Josiah Crowley had intended to disinherit the
Tophams, but they had no idea what could
have become of the later will. They had been
led to expect a small inheritance, and were disappointed
that everything was to go to the Tophams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you talk with Abigail Rowen?”
Matilda suggested at the conclusion of the interview.
“She took care of Josiah once when
he was sick, and he thought a lot of her. She
knew more about his queer ways than any
other living person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it would do a particle of
good,” Edna interposed. “Abigail is getting
along in years, and her memory isn’t what it
used to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after dark when at last Nancy took
leave of the Turner sisters and headed her
roadster toward home. She was tired and
hungry as well as discouraged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So far I’ve only wasted my time,” she
thought despondently. “I’m no closer to finding
the will than I ever was, and I’m sure
there is one. I’ve often heard father say that
no real mystery is solved without a lot of hard
work—and I’m ready to believe it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the exception of Abigail Rowen, Nancy
had called upon all of the Crowley relatives.
From what the Turner sisters had told her,
she was doubtful that a visit to her cottage
would be worth while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, I suppose I may as well go there
to-morrow,” Nancy decided, after a mental debate.
“She’s my last hope. If I fail there,
I’ll be forced to give up.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Vital Information</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“This must be the house. It certainly fits
the description given me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she spoke Nancy Drew paused before a
square, one-story frame building which stood
dejectedly in the center of a yard overgrown
with weeds and dandelions. The cottage was
sadly in need of paint and pickets were missing
from the sagging fence which enclosed it. A
boardwalk which led to the front porch had
begun to rot away, and offered treacherous
footing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The place looks deserted, but I’m sure
Abigail Rowen must live here,” Nancy assured
herself as she made her way up the walk, gingerly
avoiding loose boards which threatened
to fly up at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early that morning she had left River
Heights in her final quest for information concerning
the Crowley will. Nancy did not know
exactly where Abigail Rowen lived, but she
had taken the West Lake Road and had made
inquiry along the way. Neighbors had assured
her that she could not miss the place, as
it was the most run-down house along the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Abigail can’t help me, I’m at the end of
my string,” Nancy thought, as she rapped on
the front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no response to her knock and she
rapped a second time. She was about to turn
away in disappointment when a slight noise
within the house attracted her attention. She
was certain her rap had been heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there?” a muffled voice called. “If
you’re a peddler I don’t want anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not a peddler,” Nancy called out reassuringly.
“Won’t you let me in, please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long silence, and then the quavering
voice replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t open the door. I’ve hurt myself
and can’t walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy hesitated an instant, and then pushed
open the door. As she stepped into the dreary
living room, she saw the pitiful figure on the
couch. Abigail Rowen lay huddled under a
ragged old shawl, her withered face drawn with
pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Nancy Drew and I’ve come to help
you, Miss Rowen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the words, the old lady turned her head
and regarded Nancy with a stare which was
almost childlike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve come to help me?” she repeated
unbelievingly. “I didn’t think anyone would
ever trouble themselves about old Abigail
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, let me arrange the pillows for you.”
Gently, Nancy moved the old woman into a
more comfortable position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yesterday I fell down the cellar stairs,”
Abigail explained. “I hurt my hip and
sprained my ankle. I can’t take a step without
it nearly killing me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you had a doctor?” Nancy asked
in astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t been a soul come near me,”
Abigail sighed. “I’ve just laid here on my bed
and wondered how soon the end would come.
I’m getting along in years now and it won’t
be long——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense,” Nancy protested brusquely, for
she saw that the old lady’s trouble had made
her morose. “You have a good many happy
years yet before you. Can you walk at all?
Are you certain your hip isn’t broken?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can walk a little, but it hurts something
awful when I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then your hip isn’t broken,” Nancy said,
in relief. “Let me see your ankle. Why, you
don’t even have it wrapped up! Where are
the bandages? I’ll fix it for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a white rag in the closet in the
kitchen,” Abigail told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shook her head sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A rag won’t do. You have a bad sprain
and it must be taken care of properly. You
really should have a doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t afford it,” Abigail murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me pay for it,” Nancy begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abigail shook her head stubbornly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not take charity. I’d rather die in
my bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you’re set on not having a doctor,
I’m going to the nearest drug store and get
bandages and a number of other things,”
Nancy insisted. “But before I go, I’ll make
you a cup of tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t any tea in the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll get some. What else do you
need?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need ’most everything, but I can’t afford
to pay for it. You might get me some tea and
a loaf of bread. That’s enough. You’ll find
the money in a jar in the cupboard. It’s not
very much, but it’s all I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be back in a few minutes,” Nancy
promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped in the kitchen long enough to
examine the cupboards. As she had suspected,
they were practically empty. With the exception
of a little flour and sugar and a cheap can
of soup, there appeared to be nothing in the
house to eat. Nancy discovered the money jar,
but an investigation revealed that it contained
less than five dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s probably every cent poor Abigail has
in the world,” she thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy did not take any money from the jar
but quietly slipped out the back door. Hurrying
to the roadster which she had left at the
roadside, she drove to the nearest store and
ordered nearly ten dollars worth of groceries.
She wished that she might take a doctor back
with her, but she realized that Abigail was set
in her ways and would not accept the service
since she could not pay for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before she returned to the cottage, Nancy
stopped at the drug store and purchased bandages
and liniments. She carried the supplies
into the house and quickly set about making
Abigail more comfortable. She bathed the
swollen ankle and bound it neatly with the
clean bandage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It feels better already,” Abigail told her
gratefully. “I dunno what I’d of done if you
hadn’t come when you did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as she had attended to the woman’s
immediate needs, Nancy built a fire in the
kitchen range and put on the teakettle. While
she was waiting for the water to boil, she raised
the drawn shades and permitted the warm
sunshine to flood into the room. While she did
this she told Abigail Rowen something about
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the tea had steeped she poured Abigail
a cup and urged her to eat the nourishing meal
she had prepared. She was gratified to observe
that almost immediately the old woman
became more cheerful and seemed to gain
strength. She sat up on the couch and appeared
eager to talk with Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There ain’t many folks that are willing to
help an old woman. If Josiah Crowley had
lived things would have been different,” she
declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s strange that he didn’t provide for you
in his will,” Nancy replied quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not wish to excite the old woman
by telling her real mission, and yet she was
eager to find out what Abigail knew about the
missing will. She hoped that she might lead
her tactfully into a discussion of Josiah Crowley’s
affairs without raising hopes which might
never be realized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my opinion that Josiah did provide for
me,” Miss Rowen returned impressively.
“Many a time he said to me: ‘Abigail, you’ll
never need to worry. When I’m gone you’ll be
well taken care of by my will.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then everything was left to the Tophams,”
Nancy encouraged her to proceed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was according to the first will. But
there was another one. I dunno what became
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure there was another will?”
Nancy inquired almost too eagerly, for Abigail
looked at her rather sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I am. I’m as sure of it as I am
that I’m sitting here. Why, I saw that will
with my own eyes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw it!” Nancy gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman nodded gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mind, I didn’t see what was <span class='it'>in</span> the will.
One day Josiah came in where I was sitting in
my rocking chair, and right off I noticed he
had a piece of paper in his hand. ‘Abigail,’
he said, ‘I’ve made my will. I fooled them
lawyers and wrote it myself.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long ago was that?” Nancy asked
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see,” Abigail frowned thoughtfully.
“No, I can’t remember the exact date. It was
about the time Josiah went to live with Richard
and Cora. Well, to go on with what I was
saying—when Josiah showed me the will he
seemed mighty tickled about it. Mind, he
didn’t show me what was inside but he hinted
that he’d done well by me. ‘But Josiah,’ I
said to him, ‘are you sure it’s legal to write
it yourself?’ ‘Of course it is,’ he said to me.
‘A lawyer told me it was all right just so long
as I had it witnessed.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know who witnessed the will?”
Nancy broke in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t ask him and he didn’t say. He
just went out of the room, chuckling in that
funny way he had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you any idea what became of the
will?” Nancy asked hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon he hid it somewhere. That would
be like Josiah. But I remember he did say
something about putting it ‘where nobody can
get it unless they have legal authority.’ So
I dunno what became of it. For all I know,
he may have turned it over to a lawyer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you certain that was all he said?”
Nancy inquired gently. She knew that Abigail
had grown rather childish and that her memory
was failing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me he did say something about
what he was going to do with that will, but I
can’t just recollect.” Abigail shook her head
and sighed. “Many a night I’ve laid awake
trying to think what it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to Nancy that as victory was almost
within her grasp, it had been snatched
from her. Undoubtedly, Abigail Bowen held
the secret of the Crowley will locked in her
brain. And it was equally likely that she
would never be able to recall the vital information
unless in some unusual way her memory
was given a particular stimulus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try to think!” Nancy begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t remember,” Abigail murmured
hopelessly. “I’ve tried and tried.” She leaned
against the cushions and closed her eyes, as
though the effort had exhausted her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that very moment the clock on the mantel
chimed three. Abigail Rowen’s eyes fluttered
open and an odd expression passed over her
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant she stared straight before her
and then slowly turned her head and fastened
her eyes on the clock.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span><h1>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Abigail’s Disclosure</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When the mantel clock finished striking the
hour of three, Abigail Rowen’s lips began to
move. Nancy Drew leaned forward eagerly,
fearful lest a single word escape her. She
sensed that the striking of the clock at a psychological
moment had started a train of
thought coursing through the old woman’s
mind, and now she believed that an important
disclosure was about to be made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The clock,” Abigail whispered so softly
that the words were scarcely audible. “That
was it! The clock!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Josiah Crowley hid the will in a clock?”
Nancy prompted her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Abigail shook her head and sighed
again. “That wasn’t it. I thought I had it,
and then it slipped my mind. I seem to recollect
that he said something about a clock, but
that wasn’t it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abigail continued to stare at the timepiece,
as did Nancy, who was at a loss to understand
what connection it could have with the missing
will. Suddenly, a low cry came from the old
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! It came to me just like that! After
all these years——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me,” Nancy commanded quietly, for
she feared that the knowledge might slip from
the old lady before she could disclose it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A notebook!” Abigail brought out triumphantly.
“It was something about a notebook!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me more about the notebook,” Nancy
urged gently. Although she could scarcely
hide her eagerness, she forced herself to speak
quietly lest she excite Miss Bowen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember it all now. Josiah wrote about
the will in a little notebook of his. One day
he said to me: ‘Abigail, after I’m dead if my
will doesn’t come to light, you can find out all
about it in this little book of mine.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What became of the notebook, Miss
Bowen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t seem to recollect. He hid it someplace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Nancy Drew was baffled. Involuntarily,
her eyes traveled to the mantel clock.
She studied it critically. What connection
could the clock have with the missing will, she
asked herself. Certainly there must be one,
for otherwise its striking would not have
caused Abigail to think of the notebook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy had studied psychology in school and
was familiar with the power of suggestion and
association. Now her keen mind jumped to
the conclusion that a clock had something to
do with the missing Crowley will. Could it
be that the notebook had been hidden in the
clock?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impulsively, Nancy got up and went over to
the mantel. She took down the clock and
looked inside. She saw nothing but a tiny key
which evidently was used to wind the timepiece.
Disappointed, she returned to her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where was Josiah Crowley living at the
time he told you about the notebook?” she
asked the old lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was living in his own house then, but
he was just getting ready to go to the Tophams.
He’d been visiting around with his various kin
and letting his own house stay empty. After
the Tophams asked him to live with them, he
sold his home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What became of the household goods?”
Nancy inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the Tophams got ’most everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There must have been a family clock,”
Nancy mused, half to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A family clock?” Abigail repeated. “Oh,
yes, there was a clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you describe it?” Nancy questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it was just an ordinary mantel clock,
tall, and with a square face. Something like
that one over there.” The old lady pointed to
the timepiece Nancy had just examined. “Only
Josiah’s was more elaborate. It had a moon
or something on top.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What became of the clock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno,” Abigail responded indifferently.
“I suppose the Tophams got it. They took
everything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the tip of Nancy’s tongue to tell
Abigail that Josiah Crowley might have hidden
his will inside the family clock, but she hesitated
to excite the old lady. After all, it was
only a theory, and it would not be kind to
encourage Abigail Bowen to believe there was
a likelihood of gaining an inheritance unless it
were a fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll wait until I’m sure before I say anything
about it to her,” Nancy decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She asked a number of other questions, but
it was soon apparent that Abigail had told
all that she could recall about the will. Although
Nancy spoke of the family clock a
number of times, its mention did not seem to
interest the old lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Nancy arose to depart, but before
leaving she promised Abigail she would return
in a few days to see how she was getting along.
It was likewise her intention to stop at the
nearest house to ask a neighbor woman to look
after the old lady during her absence, but she
said nothing of this, as she knew Abigail would
protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After attending to the mission, she sprang
into her roadster and started for River Heights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew was highly elated at the information
she had gleaned, and was now more
interested in the case than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not tell the Horner girls what I have
learned,” Nancy advised herself. “At least
not until I have learned more about the family
clock. If nothing comes of my theory, Allie
and Grace would only be disappointed. I’ll
not raise their hopes until I have something important
to tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy drove along on the West Lake
Road she reviewed the facts of the Crowley
case. Unquestionably, Josiah Crowley had
made a second will. According to Abigail
Rowen he had secreted it in a safe place and
had written its location in a little notebook. He
had told Abigail where the notebook could be
found in case of his death, and with the passing
years, the knowledge had slipped away
from the old lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my opinion that Josiah Crowley hid
the notebook in the family clock,” Nancy reasoned.
“Otherwise, why would Abigail have
said anything about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy was at a loss to know how to proceed.
She knew that her next step in unraveling
the mystery was to search the Crowley
clock, but this would not be easy to accomplish.
If, as Abigail had indicated, the clock had
fallen into the hands of the Tophams, the task
might be an impossible one. Then, too, it was
not at all unlikely that the Tophams had already
discovered the notebook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case they would have destroyed it,”
Nancy told herself. “Still, from the conversation
I overheard in the park, I feel reasonably
certain the notebook has never been found.
No, if Josiah Crowley ever hid it in the clock,
it must still be there, and it’s up to me to get
hold of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the long ride to River Heights, Nancy
Drew mulled over the perplexing problem, but
try as she would she could think of no way
to get her hands on the old clock. She must
find some means of gaining entrance to the
Topham residence!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t very well climb through a window,
much as I would like to,” she laughed. “And
if I pay a social call upon the Tophams, they’re
sure to be suspicious. We haven’t been friendly
for years, and since Ada and Isabel discovered
that I have taken an interest in the Horner
girls, they would be certain to question my motive
in going to their house. No, I must think
of a good excuse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, Nancy reached River Heights.
She drove the roadster down the boulevard
and stopped in front of her home. As she
stepped out and was preparing to go into the
house, she heard her name called. Wheeling
about, she saw a girl running toward her. It
was one of Nancy’s chums, Helen Corning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Nancy,” Helen called. “I haven’t
seen you for days. Where do you keep yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed as she greeted her chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve been especially busy lately. Come
into the house and we’ll have a chat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t, Nancy. I wouldn’t be up this
way, but I’m trying to sell tickets for a charity
dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many have you sold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have six left.” Helen sighed. “It’s a
thankless job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take two if that will help you out,”
Nancy offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will it help me? Say, if I ever get rid of
these tickets I’m going to dance a hornpipe.
If I don’t sell them this afternoon it’s going to
fix it so I can’t start for Moon Lake. I wish
I’d never promised to sell the things!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moon Lake?” Nancy asked, in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’m going to a girls’ camp there. I
had planned to leave to-night; but unless I get
rid of these tickets I don’t see how I can. I
wish you were going with me to Moon Lake,
Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I, Helen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you come along then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t,” Nancy protested. “I’m involved
in something important and I can’t get
away. I’d love to go though—really, I would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you find you can make it later, just
hop into your roadster and come along. I’ll
be there for two weeks. That is, if I ever get
rid of these charity tickets. I can’t leave until
I’ve sold them. I’d pay for them out of my
allowance, only I’ve spent it already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are in difficulties,” Nancy laughed.
She reached in her purse. “How much are
the tickets, Helen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two dollars each. How many will you
take?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, give me two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Helen extended the tickets, a sudden
thought struck Nancy Drew. A pleased light
broke over her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have an idea, Helen! I’ll sell all of your
tickets for you! How will that suit you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not joking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never was more serious in my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the tickets are yours. But let me
warn you it won’t be easy to sell them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll enjoy trying it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must say you have queer ideas of
fun,” Helen commented dryly. “But I’ll not
argue with you. This will be fine for me. Now
I’ll be able to start for camp this afternoon.
Here are the tickets.” She handed them over
with evident pleasure. “Good luck to you,
Nancy. You’ll need it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Helen Corning had gone on down the
street, Nancy Drew walked slowly toward the
house. She regarded the charity tickets meditatively
and chuckled softly to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s once when I killed two birds with
one stone! These tickets will serve as my passport
to the impregnable Topham fortress!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Visiting the Tophams</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was nearly three o’clock of the following
afternoon when Nancy Drew paused in front
of the Topham residence on Highland Boulevard.
She surveyed the structure with distaste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house was a large, pretentious affair of
nondescript type. It was set back from the
street and seemed to look down rather aloofly
upon the surrounding homes. Even a casual
glance at the lawn revealed that it had been
“landscaped” with a vengeance. In an effort
to “do it in proper style,” Mrs. Topham had
crowded the yard with sundials, benches, bird
houses, and statues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such lack of taste!” Nancy thought, as she
walked up the path to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lifted the knocker on the front door.
Nancy Drew realized that the interview was
apt to be an unpleasant one, and she braced
herself for the ordeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must be diplomatic,” she advised herself,
“or I’ll not learn a thing about that clock.
If they suspect what I am about, they may
bounce me out on my ear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment a uniformed butler opened
the door and condescendingly waited for Nancy
to state her mission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell Mrs. Topham that Miss Drew is calling,”
she directed. “I am selling tickets for
the charity dance. It’s one of the most important
social functions of the year. I am sure
Mrs. Topham will wish to attend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy was forced to wait until the butler
returned with permission for her to enter. As
she was finally ushered into the living room,
she could not help but smile at the elaborate
formality, for in spite of Mrs. Topham’s lofty
ambitions, the woman had never achieved the
commanding position in society that she
strove for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room in which Nancy found herself was
even more bizarre than she had anticipated.
Expensive oriental rugs clashed with window
draperies of a different hue. The walls were
heavy with paintings which were entirely out
of place in such a small room, and period furniture
had been added indiscriminately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nancy Drew was not interested in Mrs.
Topham’s lack of taste. As soon as the butler
had left her alone she hastily glanced about.
Almost at once her eye fastened upon a mantel
clock which rested above the fireplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if that can be the Crowley clock?”
Nancy thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rather doubted it, for the clock was too
modern in appearance. She would have
crossed the room to examine it, but a sound in
the hall caused her to hesitate. As she heard
someone coming she sank down on an uncomfortable
ladder-back chair and assumed an expression
of composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Topham sailed grandly into the room
and after surveying her for a minute, took a
seat opposite Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” she demanded coldly. “What
is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am selling tickets for the——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want them!” Mrs. Topham broke
in rudely. “I can’t be handing out my money
to every peddler that comes along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Topham, I am not a peddler,” Nancy
said cuttingly, as the color mounted to her
cheeks. With difficulty she kept her temper
in check. “Perhaps you didn’t understand my
name. I am Nancy Drew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh.” A slight change came over Mrs.
Topham’s face, for she was fully aware that
Carson Drew and his daughter were cordially
welcomed in River Heights homes which merely
tolerated the Tophams or, in a few cases,
barred them. “I didn’t catch the name, Miss
Drew. What is it you are selling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tickets for the charity dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I hardly know what to say,” Mrs.
Topham hedged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was apparent that she was afraid to offend
Nancy, and yet she was unwilling to part
with the money. Although the Tophams were
well-to-do, it was common knowledge that Mrs.
Topham was decidedly stingy where other persons
were concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much are the tickets?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two dollars each.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that’s positively exorbitant!” Mrs.
Topham protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we are selling the tickets for charity,”
Nancy explained. “I assure you the cause is
an excellent one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Mrs. Topham could reply, the front
door opened and Isabel and Ada entered the
house. Unaware of the visitor, they paused
in the hall and carried on a disgruntled conversation.
Evidently, they had been making
social calls and were angry because some
woman had refused to see them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her maid said she wasn’t at home, but I
know she was,” Nancy heard Ada complain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two sisters entered the living room, and
when they saw Nancy stopped short and stared
rudely at her. They did not speak a word of
greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Drew is selling tickets to a dance,”
Mrs. Topham informed her daughters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t buy them,” Ada advised harshly.
She had not forgotten the scene in the department
store and longed to avenge herself upon
Nancy, whom she considered responsible for
her humiliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Ada,” Mrs. Topham protested feebly,
“I thought it might help our social standing
to take a few tickets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be silly, mother,” Ada snapped.
“You’ll only waste your money. We don’t
want to go, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I won’t buy the tickets. Good
afternoon, Miss Drew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reluctantly, Nancy arose. She was somewhat
taken aback at the unceremonious dismissal,
for she had not accomplished the real
purpose of her visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she turned, Nancy saw that Richard
Topham blocked the door. He had entered so
quietly that his arrival had been unobserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute, Miss Drew,” he said. “How
many tickets have you there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four,” Nancy gasped in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take them all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a grand gesture, Richard Topham
opened his pocketbook and carelessly pulled
out a twenty dollar bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep the change,” he ordered with assumed
indifference. “Give it to the charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Richard!” his wife gazed at him with disapproval.
“Have you lost your mind? A
twenty dollar bill!” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s you who can’t see beyond your nose,”
Mr. Topham retorted, but in a low voice.
“You’re always trying to get into society, and
then you pass up a real opportunity. This donation
will get our names into the paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slumped into the nearest chair, and, opening
the afternoon paper, buried himself in the
stock page. Mrs. Topham knew that the matter
was closed, for she scarcely dared speak
to her husband when he was absorbed in the
market reports. Nancy, too, realized that she
had no excuse for prolonging her stay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really must be going,” she said quickly.
“What time is it, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a clock in front of you,” Isabel
told her pointedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, so there is,” Nancy returned pleasantly.
She glanced at the timepiece as though
she had never seen it before. “Oh, surely that
can’t be the old Crowley clock? I’m so interested
in heirlooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say not! This is a far more
expensive clock than the one Josiah Crowley
left us,” Mrs. Topham informed her caller
condescendingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed? But I suppose you still have the
family clock stored away in your attic. It’s
so hard to part with heirlooms.” Cleverly,
Nancy led Mrs. Topham to further disclosures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t hard to part with that old-fashioned
thing,” Mrs. Topham returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We didn’t want it cluttering up the attic,”
Isabel added. “Crowley left so much old
junk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We considered the clock entirely out of
place in our modern home,” Mrs. Topham continued;
“so we sent it up to our bungalow on
Moon Lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unwittingly, Mrs. Topham had given Nancy
the information which she sought. The purpose
of her visit accomplished, the girl politely
thanked the Tophams for the purchase of the
charity tickets and quickly took her leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she walked down the path to the street
she chuckled softly to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tophams may be old schemers, but this
time they weren’t so clever! Unless I am mistaken
those tickets will prove the most expensive
ones they ever bought! Before they get
through it may cost them the Crowley fortune!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Following a Clue</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Although highly elated at what she had
learned from the Tophams, Nancy Drew was
at a loss to know how to proceed. Undoubtedly,
the old Crowley clock was set up in the
bungalow at Moon Lake, but to get there was
another matter. Nancy was determined to
profit by the information, but was confronted
with a number of serious problems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moon Lake was located among the hills forty
miles away, and the roads were not of the best.
Nancy did not know the exact location of the
Topham cottage. Then, too, she needed an
excuse for making the long trip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the Tophams learn I have gone to Moon
Lake they may become suspicious,” she counseled
herself. “I must think of some excuse
to broadcast as a smoke screen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But try as she would, Nancy could think
of nothing. She took a certain amount of pride
in her detective work, and now that she felt
she had struck a valuable clue, she did not wish
to ask advice from her father. She preferred
to solve the mystery herself and then surprise
him with the solution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dinner that night, Nancy was unusually
silent and Carson Drew commented on her preoccupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me you have been looking troubled
lately,” he observed. “Do you feel well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never felt better in my life,” Nancy
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the same, I believe you need a vacation.
I realize that it isn’t easy for a girl your age
to look after a big house like this. After a
time, the responsibility gets to be wearing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How stupid of me!” Nancy exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her excitement, she permitted a fork to
fall from her hand and clatter against the
plate. Carson Drew, who did not comprehend
what was passing through his daughter’s mind,
looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stupid?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I mean it was strange I didn’t think
of Helen Corning before this,” Nancy said
hastily. “Helen is going to a girls’ camp on
Moon Lake. I’m dying to go to Moon Lake!
May I start the first thing in the morning?
I know I can get in. They have room for half
a dozen more girls, Helen said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it would be an excellent idea,
Nancy. A nice rest will do wonders for you.
Go, by all means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew was delighted that she had
stumbled upon an excuse which would make it
appear natural for her to go to Moon Lake.
Early the next morning, after packing a suitcase,
she started off in the roadster. As it was
not out of her way to go by the River Road,
she decided to stop at the Horners and give
Grace the dress goods she had promised her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she drove in at the gate, one glance told
Nancy that something was wrong. She saw a
number of dead chickens in the barnyard, and
as the Horner girls came toward her from the
direction of the hen house, it was evident that
Allie had been crying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what is the matter?” Nancy asked
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s my chickens, Nancy. They’re all
dying. I can’t understand it. This morning
when I went to feed them I found ten dead.
I’m so discouraged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yesterday a fox took two,” Grace
added. “I guess fate is against us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I’ll lose all of my chickens before
I get through,” Allie declared unhappily.
“I don’t know what is killing them. They
seem to have a strange disease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allie is all broken up,” Grace said quietly.
“She’s worked so hard with her chickens.
Most of them are pets. And then, we need the
money so badly. Now that dressmaking has
fallen off, the chicken money is our only means
of support.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, won’t you let me help?” Nancy
begged reaching for her pocketbook. “Accept
a little loan to tide you over?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace shook her head firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you for your kindness, Nancy; but
we can’t take your money. We’ll manage
somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only Uncle Josiah had provided for us!”
Allie sighed. “You haven’t learned anything
more about the second will, Nancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t anything definite to report,”
Nancy replied, evading the question. She did
not wish to raise false hope and she thought
it best not to tell of her discovery. “But I’m
still hoping we’ll be able to trace the will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt it,” Grace commented pessimistically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m on my way to Moon Lake now,” Nancy
told the girls. “I stopped here to deliver the
dress goods.” She handed a package to Grace.
“The pattern is inside and I’m easy to fit, so
you’ll have no trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace’s face brightened as she accepted the
bundle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Nancy, I can’t thank you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I who should thank you,” Nancy
laughed. “And now let me pay for the dress
in advance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Grace stubbornly shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not until the work is finished. That isn’t
good business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy saw that Grace and Allie were too
proud to accept help, and regretfully abandoned
the idea of trying to give them money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come back in a few days for a fitting,”
she promised, as she prepared to drive away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s talk with the Horner girls had left
her rather depressed, for she realized that in
spite of their pride, Allie and Grace would soon
be forced to accept charity. Oh, if only she
could help them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And poor old Abigail,” Nancy thought.
“If Josiah Crowley had used a grain of sense,
things wouldn’t be in such a muddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy soon branched off from the River
Road and headed south toward Moon Lake.
The highway was little traveled and it was
necessary for her to devote all of her attention
to driving. The road had not been dragged
after a recent rain and the ruts were deep.
Jagged rocks and stones were scattered in the
path, and it seemed to Nancy that the hills
went straight up and straight down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, she noticed that the roadster had
taken a strange notion to turn to the left of
the road in spite of her efforts to keep it in
the middle. Not without foreboding of trouble,
she stopped the car and got out to make a tour
of inspection. As she had suspected, a rear
tire was flat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A puncture!” Nancy murmured in disgust.
“If that isn’t just my luck! Oh, well, I suppose
I must fix it myself, because there won’t
be another car along for an hour on this road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not the first time Nancy Drew had
changed a tire, but she never relished the task.
Rummaging under the seat, she pulled out the
tools and quickly jacked up the rear axle. She
loosened the lugs which held the tire in
place, and tugged at it. Again and again she
pulled, but the huge balloon tire could not be
budged. Then, as she gave one mighty tug,
it came off and Nancy Drew fell backwards into
a sitting posture in the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s off, anyway,” she told herself
with satisfaction, as she brushed the dirt from
her clothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It required but a few minutes to put on the
spare tire and fasten the old one to the rear of
the car. Then, in relief, Nancy started on her
way again, but the accident had delayed her
nearly an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after twelve o’clock when at last she
came within sight of Camp Avondale, where
Helen Corning was staying. Through the tall
trees she caught a glimpse of a long row of
shacks and saw the smoke rising from the cook
house. Beyond, the blue lake sparkled and
glimmered in the sunlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy drove into the camp, a group of
girls gathered about the roadster. Helen
Corning came running out of a cabin to greet
her chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls, it’s Nancy Drew!” she exclaimed enthusiastically.
“Now the fun will start! Park
your car over there back of the cook house,
Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am, I too late for dinner?” Nancy demanded.
“I’m nearly starved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re just in time,” Helen assured her.
“Oh, Nancy, I’m so glad you came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long can you stay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. Until you get tired of
me probably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll stay for the rest of the summer,”
Helen laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy was escorted to the main building of
the camp, where she met the lady in charge
and registered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is to stay with me,” said Helen; and
so it was arranged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the girls walked off Nancy told Helen
about selling the charity dance tickets and
gave her the money paid by Mr. Topham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He surely was generous,” said Helen, in
surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did it just to show off,” declared
Nancy. “I am positive of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy scarcely had time to deposit her suitcase
under her cot and freshen up a bit from
her long ride, when dinner was called. The
food was plain but substantial, and already she
discovered that she had developed an enormous
appetite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner over, she was rushed from one thing
to another. The girls insisted that Nancy join
them in a hike. She returned to camp with a
desire for a good rest, but Helen Corning had
other plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re all going for a ride in the launch
before supper,” she declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you ever rest here?” Nancy groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes—at night. This is your first day
here. You’ll be used to it in a day or so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Either that or I’ll be a wreck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t want to miss the launch
ride, Nancy. You’ll have a splendid opportunity
to see all the summer cottages on Moon
Lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Summer cottages?” Nancy asked quickly.
Instantly she thought of the Topham bungalow
and wondered where it was located. Undoubtedly,
the launch ride would give her the opportunity
to find out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll go, won’t you?” Helen begged.
“You can rest after supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ll go,” Nancy promised. “You
couldn’t keep me here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although she was tired, she was really enjoying
herself immensely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six girls loaded themselves into the launch
and someone started the motor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s always a relief when the engine starts,”
Helen explained. “Every so often it balks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the little launch turned out into the lake,
it seemed to Nancy that she had never seen a
more beautiful sight. The sun, which appeared
to be sinking down into the water, resembled
a great ball of fire. Yet, she did not forget
the real purpose of the trip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tophams have a bungalow up here,
haven’t they?” she questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s across the lake from here. We’ll
come to it presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tophams aren’t there now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, the cottage is closed. There’s a
negro caretaker who looks after it—they call
him Jeff Tucker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it hard to get to the place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not if you go by launch. But it’s a
long way if you take the road around the lake.
I didn’t know you were particularly interested
in the Tophams, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they’re no friends of mine,” Nancy
returned hastily. “I was merely curious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time, as the launch chugged along
close to the shore, Helen waved her hand toward
a bungalow which was set back some
distance from the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tophams own that one,” she informed
her chum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eagerly, Nancy turned her head and looked.
She told herself that she would remember the
location.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to have a wonderful time here
together,” Helen chatted happily on. “Next
week there’s going to be a big dance, too. Oh,
there’s so much of interest at Moon Lake,
Nancy! You’ll stay, won’t you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Involuntarily, Nancy’s eyes swept the shore
and came to rest on the Topham bungalow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re right, Helen,” she agreed heartily.
“There are a number of interesting things
here! Yes, if you want me to, I’ll stay.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>An Adventure</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew had made up her mind to visit
the Topham cottage the very next day, but in
making her plans she had counted without
Helen Corning and her friends. They were unwilling
that she should be alone even for a
minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the moment she awoke in the morning
and sniffed the fragrant odor of the pines, she
was rushed from one thing to another. After
a breakfast of fruit, fried eggs, crisp bacon,
and hot corn bread, she was pressed into a
tennis game. The afternoon was devoted to
swimming and water polo. By evening Nancy
Drew was so tired she could scarcely keep her
eyes open, and she was thankful for the opportunity
of tumbling into bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow I simply must find a way to visit
the Topham cottage,” she told herself just before
she dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after breakfast the following
morning, Helen Corning announced the plan
for the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The girls have decided on an all-day hike
into the woods, Nancy. You’ll go, won’t you?”
Nancy groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re wearing me to a frazzle, Helen.
Please let me off this time. I’d like to stay
in camp to-day and just rest up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all right,” Helen agreed unwillingly.
“I’ll stay with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” Nancy protested vigorously. “I
won’t let you do that! You like to hike so
well. Please go on. I’ll have a good time all
by myself. Really, I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like to leave you, Nancy. But if
you insist——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, Helen. Please don’t worry about me.
I’ll have a good time here. If you don’t mind,
I may take the launch out while you’re gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you do, you’d better not go far,” Helen
advised her. “We girls bought it secondhand
for a song, and it’s my private opinion the
engine isn’t much good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be careful,” Nancy promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could scarcely hide her eagerness to be
off, but she was forced to wait until Helen and
her friends had started on their hike. It
seemed to Nancy that they would never leave,
but at last they trudged away with their
knapsacks slung over their shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll wish you had gone, too!” Helen
called back over her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the girls were out of sight, Nancy
hurried down to the launch which was tied to
the dock not far from the camp. She examined
the engine. She had frequently handled motor
boats, but never one of this particular make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I can manage it all right, if only
I can get the engine started,” Nancy told
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She discovered a pin sunk in the rim of a
flywheel, and after adjusting other parts, pulled
it out rather timidly. She gave the wheel a
vigorous turn to the right. She tried again,
swinging it farther and snapping back hard.
To her delight the engine began to roar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cutting down the motor, Nancy steered out
into deep water. At first she followed the
shore, but as she became more familiar with
the wheel and as the engine appeared to work
perfectly, she headed out into the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy experienced a real thrill as the little
launch responded to her hand. The lake was
as smooth as glass, and there was scarcely a
cloud in the sky. As the launch cut through
the water a tiny spray blew in Nancy’s face,
but she did not mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far ahead she could see the opposite shore,
and she headed straight for the point where she
knew the Topham bungalow was located.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only the caretaker will let me in when
I get there!” she thought, as she drew near her
objective point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was doomed never to reach the opposite
shore that day, for unexpectedly there
was a miss in the steady throb of the engine.
The motor gave one long slow wheeze and died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what can have happened to it now?”
Nancy cried anxiously. “I can’t have run out
of gasoline.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An examination of the tank revealed that it
was nearly full. Nancy studied the engine
doubtfully. Like most girls, she had never interested
herself in the mechanics of what made
wheels go around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hateful thing!” she murmured. “I believe
it stopped on purpose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Too late, Nancy recalled that her chum had
warned her about the engine. Now, as she
glanced toward shore, she saw no hope of
rescue. She was within sight of the Topham
bungalow, which appeared deserted, but miles
from her own camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For nearly an hour she worked over the engine,
but her efforts were useless. The stubborn
motor refused to start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have to sit out here all day,” Nancy
thought miserably. “This means I won’t get
to visit the Topham cottage after all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was especially tantalizing to be so close
to the bungalow and yet know that she could
not reach it. Nancy was tempted to swim, but
she gave up the idea almost as quickly as it
occurred to her, for she realized that even if
she reached the Topham bungalow she would
have no means of returning to camp. She decided
that it would be better to remain on the
lake and wait for a passing boat to rescue her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly the hours dragged on, and the launch
drifted farther and farther from shore. Never
had time seemed to pass so monotonously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one thing certain,” Nancy Drew
told herself. “If I ever get out of this launch,
I’ll never set foot in it again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The camp boat seemed to be the only one
on the lake, and as the day wore on she began
to wonder if she ever would be rescued. The
sun beat down upon her, and with the passing
hours she became hungry as well as uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After to-day I’ll never have another chance
to visit the Topham bungalow alone,” she
thought. “Helen means well, but she will stay
with me every minute. I think the best thing
I can do is to tell her I am starting for home
to-morrow—that is, if I’m ever lucky enough
to reach shore. On my way back to River
Heights I’ll stop at the Topham cottage. Helen
will be disappointed, but it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For want of other occupation, Nancy turned
her attention again to the engine. When the
sun sank into the water several hours later,
she was still bending over it, a determined look
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” she muttered as she straightened
up. “I’ve certainly done enough to it. If it
won’t go now, it never will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave the wheel a vicious swing, and, to
her astonishment, the engine began its steady
roar as unconcerned as though it had never
stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that isn’t the limit!” Nancy exclaimed
in wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hopefully, she glanced toward the shore, but
already shadows were beginning to lurk among
the trees and she knew that in less than an
hour it would be dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too late to visit the bungalow to-night,”
she decided regretfully. “I’d better get back
to camp before this engine changes its mind
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Obedient to her will, the little launch plowed
through the water toward camp, its engine
laboring faithfully. As she eased up to the
dock, Nancy saw Helen and her friends just
trudging into camp. They hailed her with
delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m nearly dead,” Helen announced. “You
were smart to stay in camp, Nancy.” She
stopped abruptly and stared at her chum.
“Why, you’re all sunburned, and you’re covered
with grease! What have you been
doing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taking a sunbath,” Nancy laughed. “By
the way, Helen, you were right about that
engine; but I don’t think it will give you any
more trouble this summer. Anyway, I’ve
donated eight hours to the cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eight hours!” Helen gasped. “You’ve not
been out on the lake all that time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It served me right, I guess. I should have
gone on the hike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while Nancy made light of her adventure,
she was disappointed. She had wasted a
day, and time was precious. Would she ever
reach the Topham bungalow? So far she had
been thwarted at every turn.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>An Exciting Discovery</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy Drew, why are you packing that
suitcase? You’re not leaving camp already?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen Corning, entering the cabin which she
shared with Nancy, stopped in the doorway and
stared in amazement at her chum, who was
folding wearing apparel carefully into her
suitcase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid I must leave this afternoon,”
Nancy admitted regretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’ve been here only three days,”
Helen protested. “Don’t you like the camp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve had a wonderful time,” Nancy
cried impulsively. “And the girls have been
so nice to me. I’d love to stay, but I can’t.
There’s something important I must attend to
at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t it wait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid not. I’ve waited too long
already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the dance, Nancy! You don’t want to
miss it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to, Helen; but I really must
go this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t understand what’s made you change
your mind so suddenly. It wasn’t that horrid
experience in the launch, was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew laughed and shook her head.
She could not tell Helen her real reason for
departing. So long as she remained at camp
she knew that Helen and her friends would not
leave her alone for a minute. It would be impossible
to visit the Topham bungalow on the
opposite side of the lake without offering explanations,
and Nancy was unwilling to disclose
the purpose of her trip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of Helen’s teasing, she remained
firm in her decision to leave camp. Directly
after luncheon she slung her suitcase into the
roadster and took leave of the girls. Regretfully,
they watched her go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, if only I can find my way to the Topham
bungalow,” Nancy thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The previous day she had casually inquired
from Helen which road led to the Topham bungalow,
but the directions had been rather hazy.
Coming to a fork, she selected the left hand
road which appeared to circle the lake. As
Helen had indicated, it was winding and narrow,
and richly sprinkled with sharp rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From camp it was comparatively easy to
reach the Topham bungalow by launch, but the
distance around the lake was nearly eight
miles. Nancy was forced to drive slowly, and
had she met another car it would have been
difficult to have passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In places the road was muddy, for overhanging
trees and bushes protected the moist earth
from the rays of the sun. The going was especially
hard because of two deep ruts which
apparently had been made by a heavy truck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what a truck was doing up this
road?” Nancy mused somewhat curiously.
“The tracks appear to have been made to-day
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she drove along, she noticed a number of
summer cottages, but as the season was late
nearly all were boarded up. At last she came
within sight of a clearing, and through the
trees caught a glimpse of the Topham bungalow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope I’ll find the caretaker,” she thought.
“I’d certainly hate to go back without seeing
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not without a feeling of anxiety, she stopped
the roadster at the edge of the road. To her
surprise, she observed that the tracks made
by the truck did not continue further. Apparently,
the truck had turned in toward the
bungalow. Nancy hurried up the path. As
she emerged from among the trees, she stopped
short and stared ahead in amazement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire camp was in disorder. The front
door of the bungalow had been flung wide open
and the side doors were likewise ajar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An overturned chair had been dropped carelessly
on the porch, and a trail of knickknacks
stretched from the house to the path. The
grass had been trampled, and there were
peculiar marks in the soft earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s something strange about this,”
Nancy murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly, she bent down to examine the
marks which were clearly visible. At a glance
she saw that the footprints had been caused by
heavy boots and there were long lines evidently
caused by dragging boxes and furniture across
the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’m beginning to see the light,”
Nancy told herself. “Now I know what that
truck was doing on this road. Unquestionably,
it was a moving van, and it came here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she examined the imprints in the soft
earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These marks couldn’t have been made more
than an hour ago, at the latest,” she decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she hurried on up the path, it appeared
to Nancy that the camp was deserted. There
was no sign of Jeff Tucker, the colored caretaker
in whose care the bungalow had been
entrusted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reaching the veranda, Nancy knocked loudly
on the door. When there was no response, she
boldly entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can this mean?” she asked herself
in dismay, as she stared at the sight before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The living room was in confusion. Save for
a few pieces, it was bare of furniture. Even
the draperies and curtains had been ripped
from their rods. The rugs were missing, as
was everything else of value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Nancy’s astonishment she found that with
the exception of one room the entire house had
been ransacked. Only one bedroom had been
left practically untouched, and as she stepped
into it, she noticed that the rug had been rolled
up and securely tied as though in preparation
for moving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy gazed at the disorder about her,
she searched her mind for an explanation.
What could it mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like a case of ordinary robbery to
me,” she reasoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy had frequently read of cases where
the summer homes of wealthy persons had been
stripped of furniture and rugs by unscrupulous
robbers who sold the valuables to secondhand
dealers and fences. In recent years there
had been a number of thefts in the vicinity of
Moon Lake, and as a protective measure many
of the cottage owners employed caretakers the
year around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had become of Jeff Tucker, the colored
man who had been left in charge of the
Topham bungalow? The place seemed deserted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy realized that the Topham bungalow,
which had been expensively furnished, would
offer a rich prize for thieves. Now, as she
viewed the evidence, the suspicion which
lurked in her mind developed into firm conviction.
She was certain that robbers had
ransacked the place, carrying off nearly everything
of value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must have taken the Crowley clock
too,” Nancy told herself with a sinking heart.
“If they have, I’ll never set eyes on it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A feeling of desperation came over the girl
as she realized that again she had been
thwarted. It seemed almost as though a cruel
fate had ordained that the mystery of the missing
Crowley will should forever remain
unsolved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s barely possible the robbers overlooked
the clock,” Nancy thought hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to look about in nooks and corners
of the bungalow. She opened closets and
poked about in drawers, but her search was in
vain. She found no clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy returned to the bedroom, she regarded
it meditatively. Why had the robbers
left this one room practically untouched?
Certainly the furniture was as valuable as that
which they had taken. Unquestionably, the
thieves had intended to strip the room, for
they had rolled up the rug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if they heard me coming and
were frightened away?” Nancy asked herself.
“I didn’t see a sign of their truck, and yet I’m
sure they couldn’t have left here many minutes
before I arrived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the thought occurred to her, she glanced
uneasily over her shoulder. She realized that
she was buried in a wilderness some miles from
the nearest house, and the knowledge that unscrupulous
men were in the vicinity was anything
but reassuring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if those robbers should still be
around here?” flashed through her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy Drew listened tensely, the very
silence of the empty house was startling. A
strange feeling came over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could almost sense that someone was
watching her every movement.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A Desperate Situation</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“How silly of me to be afraid!” Nancy Drew
laughed nervously. “Probably there isn’t a
person within miles of here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she glanced about the bungalow it was
with relief that she assured herself the place
was deserted. Yet, for some reason, she was
unable to free herself entirely from the feeling
that an unseen danger lurked in wait for her.
The very walls seemed to smirk and grimace at
her and there was an ominous something in
the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that Nancy felt certain that the Crowley
clock had been stolen, she was anxious to
get away from the Topham bungalow as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll drive to the nearest town and report
the robbery to the police,” she decided. “Those
men won’t be able to travel very fast with a
heavy moving van. There’s a chance that
they may be caught yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having made the decision, Nancy moved
toward the front door. Passing a window, she
chanced to glance out, and what she saw caused
her to pause in sheer fright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A heavy-set man with a cap pulled low over
his eyes was coming up the path toward the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, Nancy Drew was held in a
paralysis of fear. She was positive that the
man who was coming toward her was one of
the members of the robber band.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only an instant did the girl hesitate. Then
she turned and ran back into the bedroom. Too
late she saw that she had trapped herself, for
this room had no outside door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy started back toward the living room,
but before she had taken half a dozen steps
she realized that her escape had been cut off
from that direction. The man had reached the
veranda steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frantically, she glanced about for a hiding
place. The bedroom closet offered the only
possible refuge, and with scarcely an instant’s
hesitation she stepped into it and closed the
door behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy was not a minute too soon. Scarcely
had she shut the door when she heard the
heavy tread of a man’s hobnail shoes on the
floor. Peeping cautiously out through a tiny
crack in the door, she saw a rough-looking man
come into the bedroom. His face was cold and
cruel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he turned toward the closet where she
huddled, Nancy Drew held her breath, scarcely
daring to breathe naturally lest her presence
be detected. Apparently, the man noticed
nothing amiss, for his eyes rested only casually
on the closet door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s hiding place was anything but comfortable.
It was dark and musty and old
clothing hung from nails. As dust assailed her
nostrils, she held a handkerchief to her face
lest she sneeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I sneeze they’ll he sure to find me,” she
told herself. “They’ll know well enough it
isn’t an animal, even a cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt around and once came close to catching
her hand on a sharp nail. Then she felt
something soft on a shelf and imagined it was
a sleeping cat. She drew back, then felt more
cautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only an old fur cap,” she told herself, in
disgust, “and probably full of moths. Gracious,
now I feel like sneezing worse than
ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held her hand over her mouth hard and
waited in agony. But presently the desire to
sneeze passed and Nancy breathed more freely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she dared to peep out through the
crack a second time, she saw that two other
men had come into the room. From their appearance
she knew that they must be members
of the robber gang. The first man seemed to
be their leader, for he proceeded to issue
orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get a move on!” he growled. “We haven’t
got all day unless we want to be caught. Take
that dresser out of here first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men lifted the heavy piece of furniture
and started with it to the door. But they
did not move swiftly enough to satisfy the
leader, and he berated them savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you were in such a hurry why didn’t you
back the van up to the door instead of leaving
it hidden in the bushes?” one of the men retorted
angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and have someone see us from the
road!” sneered the leader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, carry this out yourself if you think
it’s so light!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From her hiding place, Nancy Drew watched
the men as they deliberately stripped the room
of everything valuable. Piece by piece they
carried out the furniture, but the girl was given
no opportunity to escape, for the leader of the
gang remained in the room while the others
made the trip to the van.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I guess we have everything now,” the
leader muttered at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to follow his companions, who already
had gone to the truck, but in the doorway
paused for a last careful survey of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that fateful moment there came a muffled
sneeze from the closet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The robber wheeled about. Walking directly
to the closet, he flung open the door and exposed
poor Nancy, who was crouching in the
far corner. Angrily, he jerked her out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spying on us, eh?” he snarled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew eyed the man defiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t spying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what were you doing in that closet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to see the caretaker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looking for him in a funny place, ain’t
you?” sneered the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy realized that she was in a desperate
situation. The look on the robber’s face
frightened her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard someone coming and I was afraid,”
she explained lamely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it was unhealthy business that
brought you here,” the man told her sharply.
“What did you hear in that closet?” Without
giving her an opportunity to answer the question,
he added with a scowl: “I warn you this
will be the last time you’ll ever stick your nose
in business that doesn’t concern you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy saw the expression on the man’s
face, there was no mistaking the ugly threat.
One glance assured her that she could expect
no mercy. The hopelessness of her situation
gave her the courage to defy him.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t hear much, but I saw plenty!” she
cried. “You’re nothing but a common thief,
and if I get the chance I’ll turn you and your
gang over to the police!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you get the chance—that’s good.” The
robber laughed mirthlessly. “I’ll do with you
as I did the caretaker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The caretaker!” Nancy gasped in horror.
“What have you done with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll find out all in good time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man held Nancy’s wrists in a viselike
grip. Her efforts to free herself were of no
avail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t do you any good to try to get
away,” her captor informed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy was desperate. Suddenly, utilizing
every ounce of her strength, she gave her imprisoned
wrists a quick upward jerk. As the
action tore her hands free, she darted for the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a cry of rage, the robber was after her.
Almost in one long leap he overtook her,
caught her roughly by the arm, and forced her
against the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much you don’t!” he snarled.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew struggled this way and that.
She twisted and squirmed. She kicked and
clawed. But she was powerless in the grip of
the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little wildcat! You won’t do any more
scratching when I get through with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go!” Nancy cried, struggling
harder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man half-carried, half-dragged her
across the room. Opening the closet door, he
flung her roughly inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy heard a key turn in the lock. The
sliding of a bolt into place followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you can starve for all I care!” the
man laughed harshly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the steady tramp of his heavy boots
across the floor told Nancy Drew that he had
left the house.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Left to Starve</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When the sound of the footsteps had died
away, Nancy Drew was overcome with panic.
A feeling of desperation came over her. She
realized that the robber had dared to carry out
his ugly threat. He had locked her in the
closet and had left her there to starve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Nancy was too frightened to think
logically. She beat frantically upon the door
with her fists, but the heavy oak panels did
not give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help! Help!” she screamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, exhausted by her efforts to force the
door open, she fell down upon the floor, a dejected,
crushed little figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe those men will come back later and
let me out,” she tried to encourage herself.
“Surely, they can’t be so heartless as to leave
me here to starve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even as the thought came to her, she
heard the muffled roar of a heavy truck as it
passed the Topham bungalow on the way to
the road. With a feeling of utter hopelessness,
Nancy heard the van depart. She knew for a
certainty the cruel, hardened rascals were
indifferent to her plight. They had abandoned
her to a horrible fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house was as silent as a tomb. Although
Nancy had little hope that there was anyone
within miles of the cottage, she again raised
her voice and shouted for help. Her cries
echoed through the empty house and seemed to
mock her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, why didn’t I have sense enough to tell
Helen Corning where I was going!” she
thought miserably. “She believed I was starting
for home. The girls will never dream that
I came here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And her father thought that she intended to
remain at the camp for a week! He would not
become alarmed over her absence until it was
too late. Oh, if only she had never left her
home in River Heights!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Someone may find my roadster at the side
of the road,” Nancy reasoned, “but it isn’t
very likely. Few persons pass this way so late
in the season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had become of Jeff Tucker, the caretaker?
Certainly she could expect no aid from
that quarter. The robber had hinted that he
had done away with the old colored man, and,
knowing the character of the rascals, it was
impossible not to believe the worst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the full significance of the situation
dawned upon the girl, panic again took possession
of her. In a desperate attempt to break
down the door, she threw her weight against
it again and again. She pounded upon the
panels until her fingers were bruised and
bleeding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last she sank down on the floor to rest and
tried to force herself to reason calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m only wasting my strength this way. I
must try to think logically. If I don’t, I’m
lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew recalled that she had once read
that it was possible to pick a lock with a hairpin.
Feeling in her hair, she found a heavy
wire one and began to work at the lock. But
in the darkness she could not see and she made
little progress. After fifteen minutes she gave
the task up in disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no use,” she decided miserably, “I’m
afraid I’ll never get out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to think of her father, of Helen
Corning, and other dear friends. Would she
ever see them again? As despondency claimed
Nancy she was dangerously near tears. Resolutely,
she tried to shake off the mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will never do,” she told herself
sternly. “Surely, there is a way to get out
of here. I must keep my head and try to think
of something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time, as a new idea occurred to the
girl, she began to rummage about in the closet,
hoping that by some lucky chance she might
find a tool which would help her force the lock
of the door. She searched carefully through
the pockets of every garment which hung from
the hooks. She groped over every inch of the
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found nothing of value, and the cloud of
dust which was stirred up made breathing
more difficult than before. The closet had become
uncomfortably warm by this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then unexpectedly, Nancy’s head struck
something hard. Quickly investigating, she
discovered a narrow wooden rod suspended
overhead. Evidently it had once been used for
dress and coat hangars as it was fastened to
either wall and ran the length of the closet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I could get that rod down, I might be
able to use it to break out a panel of the door,”
Nancy thought hopefully. “It feels strong and
it’s about the right size.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tugged at the rod with all her might.
To her satisfaction, one side gave. Another
hard jerk brought the rod down on her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To her bitter disappointment, Nancy found
as she examined the rod that it was too long to
use as a ram. But after a little experimentation,
she discovered that she could press it into
service as a wedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inserting it in the crack between the hinges,
she threw all of her weight against the rod.
At first the door did not budge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Archimedes didn’t know what he was talking
about when he said the world could be
moved with a lever,” Nancy murmured. “I’d
like to see him move this door!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she applied steady pressure to the rod a
second time, she saw that the hinges were beginning
to give. Encouraged, she applied
more force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s coming!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more she threw her weight against
the rod. A hinge tore from the casing and the
door sagged. It was now easy to insert the
wedge, and Nancy knew that success would
soon be hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, just as another hinge gave way, she
was startled to hear footsteps. Someone came
running into the bedroom, and a heavy body
hurled itself against the door of the closet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unexpected action stunned Nancy.
Could it be that one of the robbers had heard
the noise she had made and had returned to
make sure that she did not escape? She discarded
the theory as quickly as it came to her.
The robbers were far too wise to tarry, once
their disgraceful work had been accomplished.
Then, too, she had heard their moving van
leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frantically, Nancy rattled the door knob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you is a caged lion, dis time,” a rather
unsteady voice remarked. “You is one o’ dese
tough robber boys, is you? Well, you won’t
do no mo’ pilferrin’, ’cause I done got you
surrounded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me out!” Nancy pleaded. “I’m not a
robber!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of a feminine voice coming from
the closet nonplussed the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, robber boy, is you imitatin’ a lady’s
voice to th’o’ me off de scent? If you is, it
won’t do no good ’cause I’s a natural-born,
two-legged blood houn’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy thought of a way to convince him.
She let go her longest and loudest feminine
scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat’s enough! Hold yo’ siren! I’ll let you
out. Dar ain’t a man in de world could make a
racket like dat! Dis way out, lady!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Expectantly, Nancy waited, but the door did
not open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lawdy!” she heard to her horror.
“I’s done gone and misplaced de key!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Jeff Tucker’s Story</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There was another long wait and then, to her
relief, Nancy Drew heard a key turn in the
look and then a bolt shot back. Quickly she
pushed the closet door open and stepped out
into the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood face to face with Jeff Tucker, the
colored caretaker employed by the Tophams.
The robbers had led her to believe that they
had harmed the old fellow, and Nancy was
glad to see him well and happy—albeit a little
too happy, for Jeff Tucker plainly had had a
bit too much to drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jeff still knew very well what was going on
about him, but a certain alcoholic glitter in his
eyes and his somewhat unsteady stance informed
Nancy that he was not just as sober
as the proverbial judge. She suspected that
while he had been absent on his convivial celebration,
the robbers had made off with the
Topham furniture, for even in his condition of
semi-inebriety Jeff seemed to realize that something
was amiss. He stared at Nancy, then his
eyes roved about the topsy-turvy room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, white gu’l, you tell me wheah all dis
heah fu’niture is at!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy smiled in spite of herself at the old
caretaker’s bewilderment, for try as he might,
he evidently could not rationalize the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most definite information I can give
you,” she said, “is that some robbers carted it
away. If you had been here attending to your
duty, it would never have happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’At’s right! ’At’s right! Blame me! I
ain’t s’posed to be no standin’ ahmy—I’s just
a plain culled man with a wife and seven chillun
a-dependin’ on me. No mom! I ain’t havin’
no truck wit’ dem machine-gun boys!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jeff paused and passed his hand over his
forehead as if he were trying to wipe away the
alcoholic cobwebs that were accumulating
about his perceptive faculties. Then suddenly
he pointed a bony finger at Nancy and demanded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How come you heah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a fine question for you to ask!” replied
Nancy indulgently. “But I don’t mind
telling you. I arrived just as the robbers were
hauling off the last of the furniture. They
locked me in the closet. I must have been there
for hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You was in dat dah closet all dat time!”
Jeff’s voice suddenly took on a pathetic tone.
“You po’h chile! Suppose you had o’ stahved
to death in dah, or da house had burned down,
or you was scared into fits, or——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There now, Jeff. Don’t take on about what
might have happened to me. I’m all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy determined to try persuasion on the
old fellow in order to find out what had happened
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, where you were last night,” she
suggested gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Miss, it was dis heah way: I was out
in dah yard a-chorin’ around last night and a-thinkin’
how I wished I was some place whah
I wasn’t—just any place, I didn’t mind wheah.
I was just all fed up bein’ a caih-taker and
takin’ caih o’ all dis truck from mornin’ till
night. It ain’t such an excitin’ life, Miss, and
while I’s done sowed all mah wild oats, I still
sows a little rye now and den.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Jeff—I can smell that on your breath
right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jeff wiped the back of his hand over his
mouth in an apparent effort to keep his rye-laden
breath from being propagated into the
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cain’t blame me, Miss,” he protested.
“<span class='it'>He</span> give it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is this ‘he’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, dat white man who drives up in de
big see-dan. He sees me out thah and knows
how lonesome and useless I feels, so he says:
‘Jeff, hop in. I know a place where!’ So in
I hops. Course I locked up dis heah house and
de bahn and seen dat everything was safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safe! From the looks of this room one
could hardly call it that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, Miss, it looked safe and I felt
safe too when we whizzed off in dat big cah.
Den dis white man he says: ‘Jeff, how about
a little drink?’ An’ I says, ‘I don’t mind,
seein’ it’s you.’ Den I had one and some mo’
too I guess, cause aftah while I didn’t feel like
I was ridin’ in no automobeel at all. I thought
dat de chariot had done gone an’ swung low
an’ I was a-bein’ wafted off to some place in de
gen’ral direction o’ heaven!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that was a fine thing to do, I must
say,” Nancy commented. “Then what happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I comes to. I sees I ain’t in no chariot no
mo’ but I’s in a ho-tel. And I’s in bed and I’s
feelin’ pow’fui sickish-like and discouraged.
Well, I gets my clo’es on and I sees mah keys
to de house is done been pilfehed. Den I tries
to recollect what done come to pass and I gets
s’picious. I says to myself, ‘Jeff, how come dat
white man so friendly? How come he give you
drinks dat costs fo’ dollars a pint. How come
you ain’t got no keys? Black boy, bestir yo’-self.’
And here I is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you’re here all right,” Nancy returned
severely. “And a fine mess you’ve
made of it, too. What do you think Mrs. Topham
will say when she learns?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jeff rolled his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lawdy, Miss! What <span class='it'>will</span> she say? I reckon
I’s done gone and discharged myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be only what you deserve, Jeff.
You were unfaithful to your trust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you mean, Miss, trust? I don’t trust
nobody no mo’—especially no foot-loose white
boys a-travelin’ around in see-dans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t understand. I mean you didn’t
treat Mrs. Topham right in going off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon you’s right, Miss. Ole Jeff done
gone and made a fool of himself. I realize dat
whatever I gets, I’s got it a-comin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tear rolled out on Jeff’s black, furrowed
old cheek, and he wiped it away with his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Jeff,” Nancy said consolingly.
“Let’s forget about what has been done and
think about what we can do to straighten
things out. I’ll try to help you. We must report
the robbery to the police right away. Is
there a telephone in the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Miss. We ain’t got no telephone heah.
We always uses de R. F. D.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we shall have to go to town as quickly
as we can in my car. Do you suppose that
you would recognize the man who enticed you
away, Jeff?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, would I ’member him? I’d recognize
dat man in a bootleggah’s convention. He was
tall an’ slick-lookin’ with a kind of a ‘gimme’
look in his eyes. Yes mom! I suah would
know dat baby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before leading the way to her roadster,
Nancy Drew thought of the old Crowley clock
again and all that it might mean in the solving
of the mystery of the will. Jeff, as caretaker,
would surely know whether or not it was in
the bungalow before the robbery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me something, Jeff,” she said. “Was
there an old clock in the house—a tall, square-faced,
mantel clock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Miss. But all I ever done to it was
dust it. I never wound it up to see if it would
run. I’s got a watch o’ my own.” Jeff punctuated
his remarks by taking a large, silver,
open-face watch from his pocket and holding
it to his ear. “She’s done run down too. I
reckon dat I was in dat ho-tel when I should
o’ been tendin’ to dis watch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind the watch, Jeff. You’re sure
there was a clock in the house then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’s dead rights on dat, Miss. Dar
suah was! I recollects dat clock just as plain
as day. I wouldn’t fohget dat clock. No,
mom, never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy now felt almost certain that this was
the clock which contained the notebook telling
of what disposal had been made of the Crowley
will and that it had been stolen by the robbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She must recover the clock! And there was
only one way. The thieves must be apprehended
and the stolen good returned. With
this thought in her mind, she rushed out toward
her roadster, calling to Jeff to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’s a-comin Miss,” Jeff called. “Just a
minute!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He half-hobbled off behind the house out of
Nancy’s sight, while she sat waiting impatiently
in her roadster. She started the engine
and warmed it up, but Jeff still failed
to return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She called to him, but there was no response.
Finally, she could stand the suspense no longer.
Jumping to the ground, she set off to find out
what had become of the old scamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found Jeff leisurely performing an elaborate
facial ablution at the cistern pump. He
would pump his hands full of water and then,
with a great spluttering noise, dash it against
his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For goodness’s sake, Jeff,” said Nancy,
provoked, as she came upon him. “Don’t you
realize I’ve been waiting for you? Those robbers
will probably be in the next state before
we even succeed in notifying the police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Scuse me, Miss, but I’s takin’ a little
wash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you are. But can’t that wait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But dis heah wash is impohtant. I just
wants to git good and sober befo’ I goes into
dat po-lice station, and dis cold water is good
fo’ what ails me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coax, wheedle or threaten, Nancy was unable
to hurry Jeff a minute. But at last he had
finished, and Nancy, with a sigh of relief,
loaded him into the waiting roadster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she stepped upon the accelerator and the
car moved slowly out onto the highway, she
wondered where the old Crowley clock was
now and whether she would ever be able to
recover it from the thieves.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Notifying the Police</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was probably fortunate for Nancy Drew
that the traffic police were not patrolling the
road, for as she opened the throttle wider and
wider, her roadster responded with a surge of
power that sent the car along at breath-taking
speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dis ole bus can suah step,” observed Jeff.
“ ’Spose it turns turtle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry, Jeff. It won’t. I know this
roadster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew did know the limit to which she
dared go. She guided the car skillfully and
in a short time they were entering the outskirts
of Melborne, the nearest town to the
Topham bungalow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bettah slow down now, Miss,” Jeff cautioned.
“De marshal of dis town is mighty
persnickitty about how folks acts. He’s run
me in mo’n once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For speeding?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, just fo’ enjoyin’ myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I suppose you can tell me where the
jail is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Deed I can, Miss. I suah can! Fact is,
dis is my favorite jail. You goes right down
Central Avenue to Maple Street and turns to
de left, and dar you is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roadster stopped in front of the building
with a lurch, and Nancy stepped out briskly,
with Jeff following at a more leisurely gait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must see an officer,” Nancy announced
as she entered the office. “I want to report a
robbery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A buzzer rang and soon a marshal, followed
by several men, entered. Nancy quickly told
them all she know about the Topham robbery,
and to corroborate what she had said, she called
Jeff for his version.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She speaks de troof,” testified Jeff, “ ’cept
she don’t make it strong enough. First thing
dey kidnaps me so I won’t be around to raise
no ruckus. Den dey gives me some kind of a
sleepin’ powdah and pahks me in a ho-tel. But
I comes to and goes back, and dar I find dis
gu’l cooped up in a closet just as she told you.
And dey wrecked Mis’ Topham’s house and
stole all de furniture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marshal and his men listened attentively,
and plied Nancy with questions to clear
up certain points.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any idea which road they took?”
the marshal asked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. I examined the tire tracks where
the thieves had backed a truck up to the house
and noticed the pattern they made in the turf.
When we passed the road-crossing a few miles
out of town, I saw the same tracks just off to
the side of the road where they had slipped off
in turning their truck northward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you lead the way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ll do everything in my power to
help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marshal terminated the interview by
giving curt orders to his deputies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get your automobile started,” he directed
Nancy. “We’ll follow in the police car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurry!” Nancy begged as she turned toward
the door. “Those men have nearly an
hour’s start of us now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hastily, she ran to the street and sprang into
the roadster. Starting the motor, she waited
impatiently for the marshal and his men to
appear. After a seemingly interminable wait,
they came out, buckling on holsters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They piled into the “police car” which stood
at the curbing and the marshal took the wheel.
After several unsuccessful attempts he started
the motor. Jeff Tucker, who had followed the
men from the office, would have inflicted his
person upon the already overburdened car, but
as he attempted to gain the running board, he
was forced gently but firmly back upon the
sidewalk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow me!” Nancy cried to the marshal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shifting gears, she started off down the
road. At the corner she looked back to see
that the police car was following, and caught a
glimpse of Jeff Tucker who stood gazing
mournfully after the departing automobiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the edge of town, Nancy selected the road
which she felt certain the robbers had taken.
Her high-powered roadster was built for speed
and several times she was forced to slow down
in order that the marshal and his men might
keep her in sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy had gone perhaps eight or nine miles
when unexpectedly she came to a fork in the
road. Uncertain which branch-off to take, she
brought the roadster to a halt. The police car
pulled up alongside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter now?” the marshal
called out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know which way to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marshal and his deputies sprang from
their automobile and began to examine the
tracks in the road. But if a moving van had
passed that way, the tire marks had been obliterated
by other vehicles. There was no clue
to indicate which route the robbers had selected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must have taken the righthand fork,”
the marshal hazarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t the lefthand road lead to Garwin?”
The marshal nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it strikes me the robbers would have
taken that road. It seems reasonable that they
would head for a large city where they could
dispose of the stolen goods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe you’re right,” the marshal admitted
reluctantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” Nancy proposed,
as she had an inspiration. “You take
the righthand road and I’ll head for Garwin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if you should overtake those rascals,
what would you do?” the marshal demanded in
some amusement. “You couldn’t expect to
stop them single-handed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t try. I’d race back and give the
alarm. Hurry! Every minute that we delay
gives them just that greater advantage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without waiting until the marshal had returned
to his automobile, Nancy Drew backed
her car and headed down the lefthand road.
The highway was smooth, and as there was a
clear stretch ahead, she drove rapidly. She
realized that already the robbers had a big
start, and that if once they reached Garwin
she could not hope to overtake them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I’m on the right trail,” she told
herself. “That other road doesn’t lead anywhere
in particular.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After she had traveled several miles, Nancy
became less confident. Although she had passed
a number of side roads, she had kept to the
main highway, and she realized that it would
have been easy for the moving van to elude
pursuit by taking any one of the branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, the robbers can’t know that they are
being followed,” she reasoned. “It’s likely
they’ll be off their guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifteen minutes passed, and Nancy began to
fear that after all she had selected the wrong
road at the fork. Presently, as she noticed a
man with a team of horses approaching, she
determined to question him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen a large moving van on this
road?” she called out as she stopped the roadster
alongside the wagon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A truck passed me about twenty minutes
ago,” the farmer told her. “The big road hog
tried to push me into a ditch!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Highly elated at the information, Nancy
thanked the farmer and drove on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the rate I’m going I should overtake
the robbers in a few minutes,” she thought.
“Oh, if only I could get my hands on the Crowley
clock before the police confiscate the stolen
goods!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten minutes passed and then another ten.
As Nancy gazed anxiously down the road she
could see no sign of the moving van.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve missed them somewhere,” she decided,
in disappointment. “There’s nothing to do
but go back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew recalled the fact that she had
passed a roadhouse less than a mile back, and
it occurred to her that possibly the robbers
had stopped there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go back there and make inquiry,” she
thought. “I haven’t gone by a single cross
road since I talked with that farmer, so if the
robbers didn’t stop at the roadhouse I can’t
imagine what became of them. If they were on
this road I am certain I would have passed
them by this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dusk was approaching, and Nancy Drew
knew that if she were ever to find the robbers
it must be within the next hour. Skillfully,
she turned the roadster around in the road. A
few minutes of fast driving brought her within
sight of the roadhouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place was of disreputable appearance,
and Nancy suspected that it might be a bad
resort to visit. It stood back from the road a
short distance, and was half-hidden by tall
trees. The building was large and rambling,
but rather old and sadly in need of paint. A
sign on the gate read: “The Black Horse.”
Beyond the inn, Nancy caught a glimpse of a
garage and a large stable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not enter the private driveway which
led to the inn, but stopped her car at the side
of the road. Before starting to walk toward
the roadhouse, she hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like to go in there, but there’s no
other way,” she decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked briskly up the path, glancing
about in all directions for a sign of a moving
van. The door of the garage was closed as
was the door of the barn, and the thought occurred
to her that perhaps the robbers had
parked their van inside one of the buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she drew near the inn, Nancy approached
cautiously. As she stepped upon the veranda,
coarse laughter reached her ears. She tiptoed
to a window and peered inside. What she saw
caused her to start in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a dingy, dimly lighted room, three men
were seated about a table, obviously engaged
in a drinking orgy. They were the three men
who had robbed the Topham bungalow!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A Risky Undertaking</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“I must notify the marshal at once!” Nancy
Drew told herself as she recognized the three
robbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning away from the window, she crept
noiselessly from the porch and as soon as she
was a safe distance from the inn, broke into a
run. As she stepped into her roadster, a sudden
thought occurred to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those robbers must have parked their van
in the garage back of the inn. If only I could
get my hands on the clock before I notify the
police! Once the marshal takes charge of the
stolen goods, I’ll have no opportunity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Motivated by the impulse, Nancy drove on
down the road a short distance, and, rounding
a bend, came up on another side road which
led into the woods directly behind the inn. Stopping
the roadster where it would be hidden by
the trees, she got out and hurried through the
timber. Before leaving the car, she had secured
her flashlight, for already it was growing
dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cautiously, she approached the inn from the
rear. Reaching the garage, she found the
doors closed, but investigation disclosed that
they had not been locked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She opened one of the doors and looked inside.
There was no sign of a truck—only a
battered old Ford car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must have parked the van in the
barn,” she decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she opened the stable door, it squeaked
in an alarming fashion. Anxiously, she glanced
toward the inn, but so far as she could tell her
actions were unobserved. There was no one in
sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flinging the door wide, the girl peered hopefully
into the dark interior. A low cry escaped
from her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There in front of her stood the moving van!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a piece of luck!” she exclaimed, as
she viewed the truck which the robbers had
left in the barn. “Now if I can only find the
clock!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a last cautious glance in the direction
of the roadhouse, she hastily closed the barn
door lest it swing in the wind and attract attention.
With the doors shut, the interior of
the barn was dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy switched on her automobile flashlight
and played it over the moving van, she
was disappointed to note that it was a covered
one. The rear doors were closed. Nevertheless,
although she could not see inside, she was
certain the truck contained the goods stolen
only a few hours before from the Topham
bungalow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Securing a firm grip on the door handle, she
gave it a quick turn. To her surprise, the
door did not open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an exclamation of disappointment,
Nancy turned her flashlight on it and for the
first time noticed the keyhole. The robbers
had locked the van!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear, now what shall I do?” she questioned
frantically. “I’ll never be able to break
the lock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desperately, she glanced about. She dared
not remain many minutes in the barn lest the
robbers return and find her there. Yet she
could not admit defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps the keys were left in the ignition
switch,” she thought hopefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rushed to the front of the van and
clambered into the driver’s seat. An examination
of the dashboard did not reveal the keys
hanging from the ignition switch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The robbers must have taken the keys with
them,” she told herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy was discouraged. She was on the
point of admitting defeat when a thought came
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Among her acquaintances there were a number
of persons who upon occasion hid their
automobile keys under the front seat. It was
barely possible that the robbers had done likewise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy hastily pulled up the leather seat and
looked underneath. A ray of her flashlight
illuminated a small object in one corner.
Eagerly, she snatched it up and saw that it
was a key ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Luck was with me once,” she murmured,
as she ran back to the rear of the van.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After trying several of the keys, she at last
found one which would fit the lock. Turning
it, she jerked open the door. As she flashed
her light about inside the truck she saw that
she had made no mistake. The van contained
the stolen goods and it was loaded nearly to
the top.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall I do if the clock is on the bottom?”
Nancy groaned as another problem
occurred to her, “I’ll never find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dexterously, she swung herself up on the
load. She flashed the light about on chairs,
tables, rugs and boxes. There was no sign of
the Crowley clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the beam rested for a moment upon an
object in a far corner, and with a low cry of
delight Nancy saw that her search had been
rewarded. Protected by a blanket, an old
fashioned mantel clock rested on top of a center
table in the very front of the van!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She scrambled laboriously over odd pieces of
furniture as she tried to reach the clock. Her
dress caught on something sharp and tore, but
Nancy did not heed it. She snatched at the
blanket and swept the clock toward her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One glance at the timepiece assured her that
it fit the description Abigail Rowen had given
her. It had a square face and the top was ornamented
with a crescent. Nancy was almost
certain that it was the Crowley clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as she stood staring at it, her keen ears
detected the sound of voices outside the barn.
The robbers were coming back!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m lost!” flashed through her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clutching the blanket and the clock tightly
in her arms, Nancy Drew partly crawled and
partly fell over objects as she struggled to get
out of the truck before it was too late. She
was afraid to think what would happen to her
if the robbers discovered her in the van.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reaching the door, she leaped lightly to the
floor. She could now hear heavy footsteps
coming closer and closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy slammed the truck doors shut and
searched wildly for the keys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what did I do with them?” she thought
frantically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw that they had fallen from the door
to the floor and snatched them up. Hurriedly
inserting the right key in the lock, she secured
the doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deed was not accomplished a minute too
soon. As Nancy wheeled about she distinctly
heard the murmur of angry voices outside.
The robbers were quarreling among themselves,
and already someone was working at
the fastening of the barn door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Escape was cut off. Nancy felt that she was
cornered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what shall I do?” she thought in despair.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span><h1>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>What Nancy Found</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>While Nancy Drew hesitated, uncertain
which way to turn, her mind worked more
clearly than ever before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She realized instantly that she could not
hope to run to the front of the car and place
the keys under the seat where she had found
them. Instead of attempting the impossible,
she flung them upon the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then glancing frantically about for a hiding
place, she saw an empty manger. Running to
it, she scrambled inside and dropped the
blanket over her head just as one of the barn
doors swung open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three men came in, closing the door after
them, and, as Nancy had suspected, they were
the robbers. Evidently, they had been drinking,
for they were quarreling among themselves
over the division of spoils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, shut up,” the leader growled. “Get
in and let’s be getting out of here before we
have the cops down on our heads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy heard him rummaging under the seat
of the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, what did you do with them keys?” he
demanded harshly of one of his men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you suppose?” came the unpleasant
response. “I put ’em under the seat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then come and find them, and don’t be all
day about it, either!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Get out of the way and give me
a chance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the second robber went to the truck and
began a careful search for the keys, Nancy
Drew crouched fearfully in her hiding place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see what could have happened to
them keys,” the robber complained after an
unsuccessful search. “I put ’em right under
this seat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, if you’ve lost ’em—” the leader did
not finish the threat, for at that moment the
third robber stooped over and picked up something
at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here they are on the floor! You must have
put ’em in your pocket and dropped ’em out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t!” the other retorted. “I never
had them keys in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The robbers were in a quarrelsome mood and
would have engaged in a battle then and there
had not the leader interposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, cut out the comedy! We ain’t got no
time for a fight unless we want to land behind
the bars!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if we do, it will be your fault! You
left that girl to starve—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up!” the leader snarled. He rattled
the rear door of the van and found it locked.
“There’s no harm done this time. No one has
meddled with the truck. Now get in before I
give you a swift kick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a few more angry words, the three
robbers climbed into the front seat and started
the engine. Due to their inebriated condition
they had overlooked the barn doors, and before
the van could be backed from the building,
it was necessary for one of the men to get
out and fasten them back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In relief Nancy watched the men go. The
moment they were a safe distance from the
barn, she scrambled out of the manger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused long enough to make certain that
the van had taken the road to Garwin. Then,
clutching the precious clock in her arms, she
turned and ran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy darted into the woods, she cast
an anxious glance over her shoulder, but to
her intense relief she saw that she was not
being followed. There was no one to be seen
in the vicinity of the roadhouse, and the big
moving van was proceeding slowly on its way
toward Garwin, the occupants oblivious that
their whereabouts had been discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a narrow escape that time,” Nancy
told herself as she ran. “I hate to think of my
fate if I had been discovered.” She chuckled
softly at her own bravado and clutched the
mantel clock more tightly in her arms. “Oh,
well, it was worth the risk I took!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dark in the woods and Nancy could
see only a few feet ahead of her. To her chagrin
she discovered that she had left her automobile
flashlight somewhere in the barn, probably
in the manger. There was no time to go
back after it. Confident that her sense of direction
was good, she plunged through the
bushes toward the place where she had parked
her roadster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure the clock is the right one,” she
thought. “Now, if it only contains Josiah
Crowley’s notebook!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the timber there was insufficient light for
her to examine the clock, but from the hasty
glance she had given it in the barn, she was
almost certain it was the timepiece Abigail
Rowen had described to her. If the old woman’s
story was correct, she would find Josiah
Crowley’s notebook inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reaching the roadster and finding it exactly
as she had left it, the girl sprang inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go for the police as fast as I can and
send them after the robbers,” she decided.
“The Tophams don’t deserve any consideration,
but I couldn’t be mean enough to sit
quietly by and let them lose their household
goods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as she was about to start the motor,
her glance fell upon the Crowley clock which
she had placed on the seat beside her. She
was fairly overcome with curiosity to learn
what it would reveal. As she hesitated, she
found it impossible to resist the temptation of
investigating it immediately, even at the cost
of a few minutes delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impulsively, she opened the glass door and
ran her hand around the walls. There was
nothing inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone!” Nancy groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could it be that the Tophams had discovered
the notebook only to destroy it? Nancy discarded
the thought as quickly as it came to
mind, for she recalled the conversation she had
overheard between Ada and Isabel. No, they
were as ignorant as herself concerning the
location of the will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was more likely that Abigail Rowen had
been confused in her story. After all, she had
not declared that the notebook would be found
inside the clock. Nancy had made the deduction
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was almost certain I’d find the notebook,”
she murmured in disappointment. “It
must be here somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning the clock upside down, she gave it a
hard shake. Something rattled. Hopefully,
she repeated the action. Unquestionably, there
was something bulky inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be the notebook!” Nancy thought
in excitement. “Unless I’m wrong, it’s behind
the face! How can I get it off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a vain attempt to remove the heavy
cardboard face with her fingers, she lifted the
automobile seat and found a small tool with
which she could pry. It then required but an
instant to remove the two hands of the clock
and jerk off the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the cardboard fell to the floor, Nancy
peered hopefully inside and gave a low cry of
delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eureka!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, at one side of the clock, attached to a
hook in the top, dangled a tiny blue notebook!</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Capturing the Robbers</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Eagerly, Nancy Drew tore the little notebook
from the hook. The light was dim, but
by holding the book directly under the dashlight,
she could make out the words on the
cover: “The Property of Josiah Crowley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve found it at last!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly turning the first few pages, she saw
that they were yellowed with age. The writing
was fine and cramped, and the ink had faded.
These pages were crowded with business notations,
but in the poor light it was next to impossible
to make out the words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy was excited, for she was positive that
the notebook would disclose what Josiah Crowley
had done with his will. Yet, she realized
that she could not hope to read through the
book without a considerable loss of precious
time. If she were to report the whereabouts
of the robbers to the police, she must not delay
another instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll read the notebook later,” she decided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hurriedly replacing it on the hook inside
the clock, she tacked on the face again. Then
dropping the timepiece on the seat beside her,
she covered it with a blanket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Starting the engine, she skillfully backed
the roadster and headed for the main road.
Reaching the highway, she cast an anxious
glance in the direction the robbers had taken.
There was no sign of a light on the road. The
moving van had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must travel some now,” Nancy told herself
grimly. “Those robbers have at least ten
minutes start, and I may have trouble finding
the marshal and his deputies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bending low over the steering wheel, she deliberately
stepped hard on the accelerator.
The roadster leaped forward as though it, too,
comprehended the need for haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If those men reach Garwin before the marshal
overtakes them, there won’t be one chance
in a hundred of capturing them,” Nancy
thought. “It was foolish of me to take time to
look at the clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently reaching the fork in the road, she
selected the right hand turn, and with undiminished
speed rushed on. She had gone several
miles beyond the fork when far ahead she
caught sight of an automobile headlight.
Nancy promptly reduced the speed of the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The marshal and his deputies may have
given up the search and are coming back,” she
reasoned. “I must be careful not to pass
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the automobile approached, Nancy
slowed her roadster practically to a standstill.
Then as she recognized the police car, she
brought her own automobile to a halt. As the
marshal and his deputies flashed by, she cried
out for them to stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a loud screeching of brakes as the
police car came to an abrupt halt. Springing
from the roadster, Nancy ran forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick!” she called to the marshal. “The
robbers have taken the road to Garwin! If
you hurry you can overtake them! Go on and
I’ll follow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without waiting for more, the marshal and
his deputies drove off at top speed. The automobile
rounded a bend and was lost to view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant Nancy Drew stood looking
after it. Then, springing into her roadster,
she, too, was off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following close behind the police car, the
girl sped down the road in pursuit of the robbers.
The two automobiles passed the roadhouse
beyond the fork and raced toward
Garwin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We should have overtaken the robbers by
this time,” Nancy told herself anxiously, after
a number of miles had been traversed and still
there was no sight of a moving van. “They
can’t have gone very far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten minutes passed. Then, unexpectedly,
she caught a glimpse of a red tail light on the
road far ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be the van!” Nancy thought. “The
light doesn’t appear to be moving fast enough
for an automobile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evidently, the marshal and his deputies
were of the same opinion, for at that moment
the police car slowed down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t fire unless it’s necessary,” the marshal
ordered his men. “But if they resist,
pepper them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cautiously, the police car approached. As
the headlight played upon the rear of the van,
Nancy saw the license plate clearly and recognized
the numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then as the van pulled over to the side of the
road, the police car drove alongside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halt!” came the order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The van did not stop. Instead, it put on
additional speed and crowded the police car
toward the ditch. Nancy’s heart was in her
mouth as she watched, for it seemed certain
that the marshal and his deputies were
doomed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the very edge of the road, the police car
by a sudden spurt of speed forged ahead and
averted disaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halt!” rang out the warning cry a second
time. “Halt or we’ll fire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sharp crack of a revolver as
the robbers fired the first shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marshal and his deputies answered with
a quick volley. One of the shots found its
mark—the front tire. The van swerved in the
road, and as the two side wheels went off into a
steep ditch, toppled over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant the marshal and his men were
out of the police car and had covered the three
robbers. So easily had the van tipped on its
side that the men were not injured, but the unexpected
jar had thrown them off their guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take their guns!” the marshal ordered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deputy relieved the three men of their revolvers
and searched their pockets for other
dangerous weapons. Another deputy handcuffed
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Nancy, who had stopped her
roadster at the side of the road, reached the
scene. As she came running up, the marshal
turned to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you identify these men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a light was flashed upon each of the robbers
in turn, Nancy nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is the man who locked me up and left
me to starve,” she declared, pointing to the
leader of the robber band. “And the stolen
goods are in the van.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll get ten or twenty years for this,”
the marshal promised. “We’ll hold them on
several charges. You are willing to testify
against them, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if it is necessary,” Nancy promised
reluctantly. “But I don’t live in this county
and I’m anxious to get home right away. It
seems to me you have enough evidence to convict
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you don’t want to I guess there’s
no need for you to go back with us,” the marshal
admitted. “I’ll take your address and if
your testimony should be required later I’ll get
in touch with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy told the marshal her name and address,
he glanced at her with new interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’re the daughter of Carson Drew!
I see you’re following in his footsteps. Starting
in young, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was only an accident that took me to the
Topham bungalow at the critical moment,” she
protested modestly. “I don’t deserve any
credit for the round-up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not many girls would have used their
brains the way you did,” the marshal observed.
“Unless I’m mistaken, these robbers
are old hands at the game. They have been
plying their trade around Moon Lake for a
number of seasons. The residents will be
mighty grateful for what you’ve done. And
that Mrs. Topham you spoke of—she ought to
give you a liberal reward for saving her household
goods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want a reward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the same you’ve earned one,” the
marshal insisted. “If you’re shy about blowing
your own horn, I’ll take it up with this
Mrs. Topham myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know her as well as I do,” Nancy
remarked. “She’ll not offer a reward, and
even if she did I wouldn’t accept it. In fact,
I must ask you not to mention my name to her
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t want any credit for capturing
the robbers?” the marshal gasped in astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I would prefer that my name not be
mentioned in connection with the affair. I have
a particular reason for making the request.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’re a queer one,” the marshal remarked.
“You’re the first person I ever saw
who didn’t want to take all the glory that was
coming to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not mention my name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ll keep it mum,” the marshal promised.
“And if you’re anxious not to figure in
the case, I guess we can get along without your
testimony.” He turned toward the moving
van. “I’ll just have a look inside and see if
everything is here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking the keys which one of the deputies
had turned over to him, the marshal unlocked
the rear doors of the van and carelessly
glanced inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all here,” he announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy smiled and thought of the clock which
at the moment was hidden under a blanket in
her roadster less than a dozen yards away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s be getting away from here,” the marshal
directed briskly. He singled out one of
the deputies. “You stay here and guard the
stolen goods until we can send another truck
after it. I’ll see to it that these robbers land
behind bars, and then I’ll come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute,” Nancy interposed as the
marshal was about to escort the three robbers
to the police car. “I want to ask a few questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to the leader of the robbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was you who stole the keys from Jeff
Tucker after getting him drunk, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if I did?” the robber growled. “I
wish I’d finished him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unceremoniously, the three prisoners were
crowded into the police car. One of the deputies
took the steering wheel and another stood
on the running board, covering the robbers
with his revolver. There was no room left for
the marshal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going back through town?” he
asked Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s right on my way to River
Heights,” she responded without a thought as
to the purpose of the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if you don’t mind I’ll ride back with
you. There isn’t room in the police car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—why, of course,” Nancy stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once she thought of the clock which she
had left on the seat of the roadster. What if
the marshal should discover it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as the thought came to her, the marshal
started toward the roadster.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>What the Notebook Revealed</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Just—a—minute,” Nancy Drew stammered
as she darted toward the roadster,
blocking the marshal’s path. “There’s a package
in the seat. I’ll put it in the back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hastily, she picked up the clock which was
covered with a blanket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that,” the marshal interposed.
“I can hold it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s no trouble to put it in the catch-all
at the back,” Nancy assured him. “Then it
will be out of your way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the man could offer to do it for her,
she had carried the clock to the rear of the car.
Lifting the cover, she placed it on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the ride back to town Nancy Drew
was anything but easy in her mind, but she
gave no indication that she was nervous. It
was not until she had said good-bye to the marshal
at the jail that she felt entirely safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a narrow escape,” she laughed,
as she drove away. “It might not have gone
so well with me if the marshal had discovered
stolen goods in my car. It certainly wouldn’t
have been easy to explain how I came by that
clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although it was late, Nancy was determined
to return to River Heights that night. She
was anxious to examine the notebook and learn
whether or not it would disclose the hiding
place of Josiah Crowley’s second will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so eager to get home and have a
chance to dig into the notebook!” she thought
as she drove along the road. “I went through
a lot to get it and I’ll be disappointed if it
doesn’t contain good news. It will mean so
much to the Horner girls and poor old Abigail
if the will is found.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nearly ten o’clock that night when
Nancy, tired and worn from the long automobile
ride, reached her home in River Heights.
As she drove into the double garage, she noticed
that her father’s car was gone. A glance
at the house disclosed that the windows were
dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder where father can be?” she questioned
herself. “I wanted to tell him about my
discovery right away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She removed the Crowley clock from the
back of the roadster and paused an instant to
gloat over it. She was well satisfied with the
result of her detective work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Locking the garage door, she went inside
and switched on the electric light. The house
seemed deserted, for Hannah, the maid, had
already retired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father is probably working late at the office,”
Nancy decided. “Oh, well, I may as well
stay up. And while I’m waiting I’ll have a
look at the notebook!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the long ride from Moon Lake she
had been impatient for an opportunity to examine
the Crowley notebook, and now she lost
no time in finding a screwdriver. She took off
the face of the clock, and from the hook removed
the notebook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now to find what became of the will,” she
declared, as she curled up in a comfortable
chair near a reading lamp. “Oh, I hope everything
turns out right for Allie and Grace and
for Abigail Rowen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carefully, Nancy thumbed over the pages
for they were yellowed with age and she was
afraid they might tear. Evidently, Josiah
Crowley had used the same notebook for many
years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page after page the girl read, perusing inconsequential
memoranda and numerous notations
of property owned by Josiah Crowley, as
well as various business transactions made by
him. Nancy was surprised at the list of stocks,
bonds, and notes which apparently belonged to
the estate. The amount reached well over
three hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had no idea Josiah Crowley had that
much money,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time she grew impatient of the seemingly
endless list, and skipping many pages,
turned ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, the phrase, “my will,” caught and
held her attention. Eagerly, Nancy pounced
upon it and began to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve found it at last!” she told herself in
excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The notation was brief and written in Josiah
Crowley’s cramped hand.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“To whom it may concern: My last will and
testament will be found in safety deposit box
number 148 in the Masonville National Bank.
The box is under the name of Josiah Harkston.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The date of this entry was recent and the ink
had not faded as in the earlier entries in the
notebook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there was another will!” Nancy exclaimed
aloud. “Oh, I’m sure it must be in
favor of the Horner girls, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hurriedly read on, but although she
carefully examined every page in the book,
there was no other mention of the will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No wonder the will never came to light,”
Nancy mused. “Who would have ever thought
of looking for it in a safety deposit box under
the name of Josiah Harkston? In his zest for
safety, Josiah Crowley nearly defeated his own
purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her thoughts were interrupted as she heard
an automobile turning in at the drive. Rushing
to the window, Nancy saw her father drive
into the garage. As he opened the front door
she ran to meet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, hello, Nancy,” he greeted her in surprise.
“If I had known you were here, I’d have
come home sooner. I was doing some special
work on a case. Back from Moon Lake early,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Nancy admitted, trying to hide her
excitement. “But for a good reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before her father could remove his hat, she
plunged into the story of her adventures and
ended by showing him the notebook which she
had found inside the mantel clock. When she
had finished, Carson Drew stared at her with
mingled pride and amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a regular detective, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re making fun of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew’s face sobered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m proud of what you’ve done, Nancy.
I couldn’t have done better myself—perhaps
not so well. You took a real risk when you
encountered those robbers, but so long as you
are back home safe and sound, it doesn’t
matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tophams aren’t going to thank me
when they find out what I have done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly. They may accuse you of stealing
their clock, although so long as their house was
open when you entered they can’t claim that
you broke in. However, if we can manage to
keep the knowledge from them, it will be just
as well that they don’t learn the details of how
the will was found.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew picked up the notebook and
glanced through it with interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fortune will make a nice nest egg for
someone,” he commented, as he looked over
the lists of stocks and bonds owned by Crowley.
“These securities are of the best, too. All
gilt edge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope the Tophams will be cut off without
a cent,” Nancy declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s likely they will be; but of course you
never can be certain until the will is read. Unless
I am mistaken, your discovery will strike
the Tophams at an especially awkward time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s a rumor going the rounds to
the effect that Richard Topham has been losing
heavily in the stock market this last month.
He has been getting credit at a number of the
banks on the strength of the inheritance, and
I suspect he is depending on Crowley’s money
to pull him through a tight place. At least he
has made every effort to speed up the settlement
of the estate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would serve the Tophams right if they
lose everything,” Nancy said decisively.
“They never had a particle of charity for anyone.
They would let their relatives starve before
they would help them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew glanced again at the notebook
in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that you have found this, the thing to
do is locate the will at once before Richard
Topham gets wind of what is up,” he advised.
“We want to administer the <span class='it'>coup de grâce</span> before
the Tophams have a chance to get the
fortune into their hands. Once the estate is
settled, it will not be easy to wrest it away
from them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to turn the matter over to you,”
Nancy responded promptly, “I’m not familiar
with legal procedure and you know exactly
what should be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be glad to help you if I can, Nancy.
The first thing of course is to get our hands on
the will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That should be easy. We can drive over to
the Masonville National Bank the first thing in
the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but we haven’t authority to open the
safety deposit box. It may be necessary to get
a court order,” Carson Drew reminded his
daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so. I hadn’t thought of that. But
you can manage it, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew chuckled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I know the judge. Yes, I think I can
arrange it all right. I’ll tell him I am acting
as counsel for the Horner girls. I really am,
because I promised I’d help them if I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure everything is going to turn out
just as I hoped!” Nancy cried enthusiastically.
“The deserving relatives will get the
money and the Tophams will be left out in the
cold! Abigail Rowen will be able to have the
medical attention she needs, and Allie and
Grace will be fixed for life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t build your hopes too high,” Carson
Drew advised her wisely. “There may be a
slip, you know. We may fail to find the will in
the deposit box, and of course there is a chance
that Josiah Crowley didn’t dispose of the fortune
as it was expected that he would. If I
were you I wouldn’t say anything to the Horner
girls until we are certain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t,” Nancy promised, as she turned
toward the stairs. “But I can’t help hoping.
I’m going to bed now and get a good night’s
rest. Then to-morrow we’ll start off on the big
adventure! Oh, I can scarcely wait to find out
what the will contains!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half way up the stairs, she hesitated and
then returned to the living room and picked
up the notebook which rested on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all I’ve gone through to get my
hands on this, I’m not going to take any
chances!” she laughed. “To-night I’m going
to sleep with it under my pillow!”</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XXIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Looking for the Will</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When Nancy Drew awoke the following
morning, the bright sunlight was streaming in
at her open bedroom window. As her eyes
turned toward the little clock on her dresser,
she was alarmed to see that it was after nine
o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could I oversleep on a morning like
this?” she asked herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly running her hand under the pillow,
she brought out the Crowley notebook and surveyed
it with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a surprise the Tophams are going
to get!” she chuckled softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hastily dressing, Nancy hurried downstairs.
She found that her father had already left for
the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear,” she thought. “I wonder if he
forgot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment Hannah appeared from the
kitchen bearing a plate of crisp, steaming
waffles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father said I was to tell you to go to
his office just as soon as you finish your breakfast,”
she informed Nancy. “He said you were
to bring your notebook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My notebook— Oh, yes, I know what he
meant! It won’t take long to eat breakfast,”
she predicted, as she seated herself at the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a hasty meal, she climbed into the roadster
and drove to her father’s office. She found
him alone in the inner office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry I overslept this morning,” Nancy
apologized. “Have I kept you waiting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” her father assured her pleasantly.
“I told Hannah not to awaken you because
I knew you needed rest after your hard
day yesterday. And, anyway, we couldn’t do
anything about the will without an order from
the court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I saw the judge early this morning.
After explaining everything to him he gave me
the paper. I have it here.” Carson Drew
tapped an inside pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I brought the notebook with me. You
wanted it, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I thought it might be necessary to
show it to the judge, but we won’t need it now.
However, it may be well to put it in the safe.
I’ll do it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew took the notebook from Nancy
and after placing it inside a small safe closed
and locked the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When shall we start for Masonville?”
Nancy asked somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right now if you are ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After leaving a number of instructions with
his private secretary, Carson Drew followed his
daughter from the office. He took his place beside
her in the roadster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll never get over it if we don’t find the
will,” she declared, as they drove along. A
flush of excitement had tinted her cheeks and
her eyes were bright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must remember one thing, Nancy,” returned
her father calmly. “Crowley was a
queer character and did things in a queer way.
So the will may be there, and again it may not
be. Perhaps he left only further directions in
a box. I remember one case in Canada many
years ago. An eccentric Frenchman died and
he left directions to look in a trunk of old
clothes. In the pocket of a coat were found further
directions to look in a closet of his home.
There his family found directions to look in a
copper boiler. The boiler had disappeared and
was finally located in a curiosity shop. Inside,
on the bottom, was pasted what proved to be a
word puzzle. The old Frenchman’s heirs were
about to give up in despair when a puzzler
solved the puzzle and the man’s bag of gold was
found—under a board in his bedroom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but they found it, anyway,” breathed
Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trip to Masonville was quickly accomplished,
and in a short time Nancy stopped the
roadster in front of the Masonville National
Bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may as well come, too,” Carson Drew
said, as Nancy hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parking the car at the curbing, the two entered
the bank. Mr. Drew offered his professional
card and asked to see the president.
After a few minutes’ wait, they were ushered
into a private conference room. An elderly
man arose to greet them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The introductions accomplished, Mr. Drew
hastened to state his mission. Before he could
finish the story, the bank president cut him
short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid you have come to the wrong
place. To my knowledge we have never had
dealings with a man by the name of Josiah
Crowley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you did not know him by that
name. I believe he had a deposit box here
under the name of Josiah Harkston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Josiah Harkston?” the banker repeated
thoughtfully. “It seems to me we have been
trying to get in touch with a man by that name.
If I remember correctly the rent on his safety
deposit box has not been paid for some time.
If you will wait a moment I will find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The banker left the room. He returned in a
few minutes with a sheet of paper in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“According to our record a Josiah Harkston
rented box 148 from us, but the past year the
rent has not been paid. Here is his signature
if you care to look at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eagerly Nancy and her father examined the
sheet of paper which the banker handed them.
At a glance they saw that the writing was in the
cramped hand of Josiah Crowley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be that Crowley and Harkston were
the same person, as you say,” the banker continued.
“But we have no authority to permit
you to examine the contents of the safety deposit
box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have an order from the court,” Mr. Drew
said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that is different.” The banker’s attitude
underwent a sudden change. “May I
see the document please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Drew removed the paper from his pocket
and handed it to the banker. After examining
it for a minute, the president returned it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You find it satisfactory?” Mr. Drew asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly. You are welcome to open the
safety deposit box—of course in the presence
of a bank official. I suppose you have the
key?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s face fell. She had never once
thought of the key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have no key,” Mr. Drew admitted.
“Isn’t there one in the bank which will fit the
box?” He knew some small banks had this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, we did away with that when we got
our regular vault,” said the banker. “But—wait
a minute,” he added suddenly. “I think
I can help you out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He disappeared into another part of the bank
and presently came back holding up a sealed
envelope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That man had two keys for his box and he
left one here in my possession, sealed up as you
can see. As you have a court order I feel you
are entitled to this key,” and he handed the
envelope to Mr. Drew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The envelope was marked with Josiah Crowley’s
assumed name, also the number of his box.
It contained a small, flat key, nothing more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we will go to the boxes,” said the bank
official.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy and her father followed the president
into the main part of the bank. They were
then admitted into a small room which was protected
by heavily barred doors. Finally, they
entered the vault which contained the safety
deposit boxes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The president inserted a small key in a lock,
then used the key given to Mr. Drew and finally
pulled out a metal box which bore the number
148. Politely, he handed the box to Mr. Drew,
who quickly lifted the lid and peered inside.
Unable to resist the temptation, Nancy peeped
over her father’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The box was empty save for one document in
the bottom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it must be the will!” Nancy cried before
Mr. Drew could examine the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the will,” her father announced, after
a hasty glance at the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A will, eh?” said the bank official, with
keen interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and I will ask you to do me a favor.
Kindly place your initials on each page—so you
can later on identify it if necessary—and I will
do the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, Mr. Drew. I’ve done that before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Drew thanked the president for the help
he had given, and with Nancy left the bank.
Once they had gained the comparative privacy
of the roadster, they grinned at each other like
two mischievous youngsters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we put it over, eh, Nancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We certainly did. But read the will! I’m
dying to find out what it says. I can’t stand
the suspense another minute!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The will comprised several pages, all written
in Josiah Crowley’s cramped style. Mr. Drew
spread the pages out before him, and Nancy
pored over them. Not only was the fine writing
difficult to make out, but the legal terms were
confusing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going to be a terrible task to study it
all out,” Nancy complained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think we had better take it to the
office,” Mr. Drew suggested. He picked up the
last page of the will and studied it closely. “I
see Doctor Nesbitt signed as a witness. No
wonder the will never came to light. If you
remember, he died a few days after Crowley.
Thomas Wackley, the other witness, I never
heard of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t care who witnessed the will,”
Nancy said impatiently. “I want to find out
if Allie and Grace and poor Abigail got anything.
I can’t make head nor tail out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see their names are mentioned,” Mr. Drew
told her, pointing to one of the pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so glad! So long as I know they’re
taken care of I suppose I can wait until we get
to your office to find out the details. We can
have the will copied in typewriting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I want to go over the document carefully.
It is evident that Crowley drew it up
himself, and I want to make certain it is legal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do you think there is any danger it
won’t be?” Nancy questioned anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell until I go over it in detail,
Nancy. But from a hasty examination it appears
that the Tophams aren’t mentioned, and
they are certain to make trouble if they can. I
want to make sure there is no way for them to
break the will before I notify them we have it
in our possession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Drew folded the papers and placed them
carefully in his pocket. As Nancy started the
motor in preparation for the return trip to
River Heights she began to chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the will does prove to be legal, won’t it
be a blow for the Tophams? I’d give a lot to
see how they take it. I think it would be a
splendid idea to call a meeting of all the relatives
and read the will aloud!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you have a dark motive behind
that idea,” Mr. Drew laughed. “But I’ll try
to humor you this time. What’s more, I’ll
promise that you may be present when the <span class='it'>coup
de grâce</span> is administered to the Tophams!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Coup de Grâce</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, father, it’s nearly two o’clock now.
The relatives should be coming in a few minutes!
I’m so excited!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew, who stood in the living room of
the Drew home smiled indulgently at his
daughter as she fluttered about, arranging
chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you’re more thrilled than if you
were inheriting the fortune yourself,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am thrilled,” Nancy admitted. “I can
scarcely wait until the will is read aloud.
Won’t everyone be surprised? Especially the
Tophams. Do you think they will come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, the Tophams will be here. And,
unless I am mistaken, they will bring a lawyer
with them. Just as soon as they learned that
another will had come to light, they began to
worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you certain the will can’t be broken?”
Nancy inquired anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I can’t be certain, Nancy. But I
have gone over it carefully, and so far as I can
tell it is technically perfect. Josiah Crowley
was peculiar in some ways, but he was no one’s
fool. I’ll promise you the Tophams will have
a difficult time of it if they try to break the
will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After locating the Crowley will in a safety
deposit box at the Masonville National Bank in
the town of Masonville, Carson Drew and his
daughter had read it carefully. Without disclosing
the contents to anyone, they had called
a special meeting of the relatives at the Drew
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the exception of Abigail Rowen, who
was confined to her bed, all had promised to be
present. Grace and Allie Horner, although not
relatives, had also been invited to attend the
meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too bad Abigail Rowan can’t come,”
said Nancy. “But we’ll get the news to her
fast enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will probably be a great surprise all
around,” said her father, with a little smile.
“Nancy, you have done a remarkable piece of
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can hardly wait to have it all cleared
up,” cried the happy girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We may have some hard minutes with the
Tophams, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose so. I suppose anybody
would be sorry to see a fortune slipping away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll see what happens,” returned
the lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Horner girls are coming up the walk
now,” Nancy announced, glancing out of the
window. “I’m dying to tell them the news, but
I’ll wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She greeted Allie and Grace cordially and
escorted them to comfortable chairs in the living
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it true the will has been found?” Allie
whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and Grace have no cause to worry,”
Nancy assured her, with a mysterious smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had she seated the Horner sisters
than the doorbell rang again. This time she
admitted Edna and Matilda Turner, who were
dressed in their best black silk gowns. A few
minutes later, the Mathews brothers, William
and Fred, arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess everyone is here now except the
Tophams,” Carson Drew commented. “We
had better wait for them a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no need to wait, for at that moment
the doorbell jangled sharply. Nancy
opened the door and the four members of the
Topham family sailed grandly in. As Carson
Drew had predicted, they were accompanied
by a lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why have we been called here?” Mrs. Topham
demanded, addressing Mr. Drew. “Have
you the audacity to claim that another will has
been found?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have the will here, Mrs. Topham,” Carson
Drew replied politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s preposterous!” Mrs. Topham stormed.
“Josiah Crowley made only one will and in
that he left everything to us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like a conspiracy to me,” Ada
added tartly, as she gazed coldly upon the relatives
who were seated about the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel did not speak, but tossed her head contemptuously.
Richard Topham likewise did
not offer a comment, but uneasily seated himself
beside the lawyer who had accompanied
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will kindly be seated, Mrs. Topham,
we will read the will,” Mr. Drew suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reluctantly, Mrs. Topham obeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you have probably learned by this
time,” Mr. Drew began, “a second will of the
late Josiah Crowley has been found in a safety
deposit box in a Masonville bank. The will is
unusually long, and with your permission I
will read only the portions which have to do
with the disposal of the property.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Drew picked up several sheets of typewriting
from the table, and after a moment’s
hesitation began to read in a clear voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I, Josiah Crowley, do make this my last
will and testament, hereby revoking all former
wills by me at any time made. I give and bequeath
all my property, real and personal, as
follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘To my beloved friends and neighbors,
Allie and Grace Horner, the sum of seventy-five
thousand dollars each.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t believe it!” Allie gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither can I!” Mrs. Topham snapped.
“One hundred and fifty thousand dollars when
they aren’t even relatives. Why, that’s nearly
half of the estate. The will is a fraud!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no mistake,” Mr. Drew told her
quietly. Again he picked up the will and began
to read:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘To Abigail Rowen, in consideration of her
kindness to me, the sum of seventy-five thousand
dollars.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so glad,” Grace murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, she’ll be able to get the medical attention
she needs,” Allie added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish she could have been here,” Nancy
said quietly. “But I’ll see to it that she is notified
before the day is over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That old lady gets seventy-five thousand
dollars?” Ada Topham demanded harshly.
“What did she ever do for Crowley?” Angrily,
she turned to her mother. “We kept him
for years. And this is the pay we get!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘To my nephews, Fred and William Mathews,
the sum of twenty thousand dollars
each,’ ” Mr. Drew read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We didn’t expect that much,” the Mathews
brothers declared, in genuine surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘To my cousins, Edna and Matilda Turner,
the sum of twenty thousand dollars each.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how generous!” Edna murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t we mentioned at all?” Mrs. Topham
broke in sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Drew smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you are mentioned, but perhaps not
in the way you anticipate. I’m coming to that
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘To Grace and Allie Horner, my household
furniture now in the possession of Mrs. Richard
Topham.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a gasp of surprise from everyone
in the room, and Mrs. Topham half-arose from
her chair. It was generally known about River
Heights that the Tophams had practically confiscated
Josiah Crowley’s furniture at the time
they induced him to make his home with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How insulting!” Mrs. Topham cried.
“Does Josiah Crowley dare hint that I took his
furniture?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure I don’t know what was in his mind
at the time he wrote the will,” Carson Drew
told her, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we have enough without the furniture,”
Grace interposed quickly. “Haven’t
we, Allie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Allie nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll not take the household goods from
you, Mrs. Topham.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew carefully folded the document
he had been reading, and after placing it in a
drawer, turned to the relatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is all there is except that there is a
proviso to pay all his just debts, including his
funeral expenses and that what little balance is
left—maybe three or four thousand dollars—goes
to the Manningham Old Men’s Home.
Fortunately, Josiah Crowley kept his assets in
a liquid state. It will not be difficult to convert
the estate into cash. For that reason I should
think it would be possible to draw on your inheritances
at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re actually cut off without a cent?”
Richard Topham asked in disbelief. His face
was unusually white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid you are,” Mr. Drew replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it can’t be,” Mr. Topham returned.
“You don’t understand. I must have the
money!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t help you. I did not make the will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a conspiracy!” Ada cried bitterly. She
wheeled upon Nancy, her face convulsed with
anger. “You had something to do with this,
Nancy Drew,” she said bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I had,” Nancy admitted pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll break the will!” Mrs. Topham announced
firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you may drag the matter into
court if you like,” Mr. Drew responded. “But
I warn you it will be only a waste of your time
and money. If you don’t wish to accept my
judgment, ask your own lawyer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Drew is right,” the lawyer said
promptly, without waiting for Mrs. Topham
to question him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he is, is he?” Mrs. Topham retorted.
“If that’s all you know about law, you’re discharged!
We’ll get another lawyer and we’ll
fight to the last ditch!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that she arose and stalked grandly
from the room. Isabel and Ada followed, after
bestowing a withering glance upon Nancy. Mr.
Topham brought up the rear. As soon as the
door had closed behind them, their lawyer
arose and picked up his brief case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t say I’m sorry to lose the
case,” he remarked to Mr. Drew, as he, too,
took his leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At once the atmosphere became less strained.
Everyone began to talk at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Nancy, I can hardly believe it yet!”
Allie declared happily. “The money means so
much to Grace and me! And we owe it all to
you, Nancy Drew! You haven’t told us how
you came to find the will, but I know you were
responsible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Horner girls and Mr. Crowley’s relatives
begged her for the details, Nancy Drew
told of her adventure with the robbers at Moon
Lake. When she had finished the story, they
praised her highly for what she had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll never be able to thank you enough,”
Grace said quietly. “But after the estate has
been settled, we’ll try to show our appreciation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the tip of Nancy’s tongue to say
that she did not want a reward when Mr. Drew
turned the conversation into a different
channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tophams will not give up the money
without a fight,” he said. “My advice would
be to ask the court to appoint an administrator
at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all want you, I’m sure,” Grace Horner
declared quickly. She regarded the others
questioningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone nodded assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And of course we want you to act as our
lawyer,” Grace added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be glad to assist you,” Mr. Drew
promised. “If the Tophams bring the matter
into court, I’ll give them a battle they’ll never
forget!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After thanking Mr. Drew and Nancy for
what they had done, the relatives at last took
their departure. Allie and Grace were the last
to leave. As they turned to say good-bye to
Nancy, Carson Drew opened a closet and took
out the Crowley clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess this belongs to you now,” he remarked,
handing the clock to Allie. “It was included
in Crowley’s household goods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what we’ll do with it,” Allie
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, the Horner girls departed with
the clock. On the porch they paused to whisper
significantly to Nancy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll hear from us again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After everyone had left the house, Mr. Drew
turned to his daughter with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we administered the <span class='it'>coup de grâce</span> to
the Tophams all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, wasn’t it funny to watch their faces
when they learned they were cut off without a
cent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They took it hard. It’s my opinion the
Tophams won’t be able to hold their heads so
high after this. Richard Topham looked
rather sick when he left. I suspect he’s desperately
in need of ready cash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tophams deserved to be cut off without
a cent,” Nancy Drew declared. “I’m so
glad everything came out right and that Allie
and Grace received the bulk of the fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they are charming girls. Unless I am
mistaken they intend to reward you for what
you did, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t surprise me. But of course I’ll
not take money from them. However, if they
should offer me a reward, I know what I shall
ask for!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you must wait and see,” and Nancy
laughed mysteriously. “They haven’t offered
me anything yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Carson Drew could quiz her, she
skipped out the side door and vanished.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A Reward</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’ve heard about the Tophams,”
Carson Drew remarked to his daughter,
one morning some months after the reading
of the Crowley will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no, what about them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re practically in bankruptcy. Richard
Topham has been losing steadily on the
stock market of late. After his failure to recover
the Crowley fortune, the banks reduced
his credit. He’s been forced to give up his
home on the avenue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, really? How that must hurt Mrs. Topham
and the two girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s undoubtedly a bitter pill to swallow.
They are moving into a small house this
week, and from now on they’ll not be able to
carry themselves so high.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope they don’t try to make any more
trouble about the will,” Nancy commented.
“Goodness knows, they’ve made enough already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tophams had not given up the Crowley
estate without a bitter battle. They had put
forth the claim that the will Nancy had unearthed
was a forged document, but they had
been unable to prove their statement. The case
had finally been thrown out of court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As administrator of the estate, Carson Drew
had advanced the Horner girls and Abigail
Rowen a portion of their inheritance. Several
weeks before, Nancy had visited Abigail and
was delighted to find her in surprisingly good
health. She had secured medical attention, and
a trained nurse was in constant attendance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I’ll run out into the country to-day
and visit the Horner girls,” Nancy told
her father. “They telephoned yesterday and
asked me to come. They hinted they had something
special to tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps they’re going to reward you for
finding the will,” Mr. Drew suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s been nearly a month since they said
anything about it,” Nancy returned carelessly.
“By this time they’ve probably forgotten all
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After luncheon, she set off for the farmhouse
in her blue roadster. It was a beautiful
autumn and Nancy Drew thoroughly enjoyed
the ride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she came within sight of the farmhouse,
Nancy was astonished at the transformation
which had taken place. The house had been
given a fresh coat of white paint and a bright
green roof replaced the old one. The yard was
well kept and beds of hardy plants had been
set out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the barnyard, many new hen houses were
going up. Perhaps the most surprising thing
was the large number of chickens in evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welcome to the chicken farm!” Allie
Horner cried enthusiastically, as she ran from
the house to greet Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never saw so many chickens in all my
life,” Nancy declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All Leghorns too,” Allie told her proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Grace Horner had reached the
roadster and she too gave Nancy a hearty welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allie is in her element these days,” she
laughed. “She’s putting in incubators, and
from now on will raise nothing but high-grade
fowls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must see everything!” Allie insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy was piloted from one place to another.
She saw the new chicken houses which were
being built and the incubators. But the thing
which pleased her the most was the realization
that Allie and Grace were happy in their work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I must be getting back to River
Heights,” she remarked after a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you can’t go yet!” Allie interposed
with a quick glance at her sister. “You tell
her, Grace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We asked you here to-day for a special reason,”
Grace began a trifle awkwardly. “You
see, we’ve been thinking for a long time that
we’ve never done a thing to show our appreciation
for what you did. We’ve talked with the
others and everyone is agreed that we should
reward——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t want a reward,” Nancy broke
in. “I wanted to help. And, anyway, it was
fun for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we wanted to do something really
handsome,” Allie cried in disappointment. “It
doesn’t seem fair not to give you a reward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one way you can reward me if you
really want to,” Nancy said after a little hesitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” Allie and Grace demanded in one
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it may sound silly, but I would like
to have the Crowley clock for my very own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is that all you want?” Grace questioned
in disappointment. “We’ll be glad to
give you a hundred clocks if you will only take
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just the old Crowley clock—that’s all I care
for. And if you particularly want it yourself——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, goodness, no,” Grace assured her
quickly. “It doesn’t keep particularly good
time and we have more heirlooms now than we
know what to do with. Wait a minute and I’ll
get it for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She disappeared inside the farmhouse, returning
in a few minutes with the old-fashioned
timepiece. She handed it to Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re more than welcome to it,” she declared
warmly, “but it isn’t a reward at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the only reward I want,” Nancy replied,
smiling at the two Horner girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see what you want with the thing,”
Allie commented. “It’s not much to look at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy did not reply at once, but gazed meditatively
at the clock. Truly, it was not handsome;
but for her it had a peculiar appeal.
She could not explain to Allie and Grace just
why she prized it, for her feeling was something
she could not put into words. Certainly
she was attached to it because of its suggestion
of her recent adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if I’ll ever have another half so
thrilling?” Nancy thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she stood gazing wistfully at the old
clock she could not know that before many
months had passed, she would be involved in a
mystery far more baffling than the one she had
just solved. Her adventures, recounted in the
next volume of this series, “The Hidden Staircase,”
were before her. Nancy Drew did not
have the power of projecting herself into the
future, and yet as she looked down at the timepiece,
she seemed to know that exciting days
were soon to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll always prize this clock as a trophy of
my first venture as a detective,” she said
quietly, turning to Allie and Grace. “It will
serve as a pleasant reminder of a thrilling adventure—and,
who knows? perhaps as a
promise for the future!”</p>
