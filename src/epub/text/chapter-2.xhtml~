			<h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A Chance Meeting</span></h1>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t forget your luncheon engagement
with Mr. Rolsted,” Nancy Drew reminded her
father the next morning at the breakfast table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll telephone him the first thing after I
reach my office,” Carson Drew promised.
“But again I warn you not to anticipate startling
news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t, father,” Nancy laughed. “But if
I should happen to learn something which has
a bearing on the missing will, I won’t be exactly
disappointed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are your plans for the day, Nancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing special. I thought I would
do a little shopping this morning. And I am
invited to a party one of the girls is giving
in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are too busy to take luncheon
with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, father, you know I’ve just been dying
for an invitation!” Nancy declared, her eyes
dancing. “I’m so anxious to learn something
about that will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, if you have time, drop in at my
office about twelve-thirty. Mr. Rolsted may
not accept my invitation, but if he does, we’ll
try to find out something about Josiah Crowley.
Of course I don’t need to warn you not
to appear too eager for information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll let you do all the talking,” Nancy told
him. “I’ll just keep my ears open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll look for you at twelve-thirty, then.”
Mr. Drew pushed back his chair and glanced at
his watch. “I must hurry now or I’ll be late
getting downtown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After her father had left, Nancy Drew finished
her breakfast and then went to the
kitchen to consult with Hannah, the maid, concerning
the work of the day. Although only
sixteen, Nancy was unusually capable, and
under her skillful direction everything ran
smoothly in the Drew household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the death of her mother six years before,
she had taken over the entire management of
the establishment. The Drews employed one
servant, Hannah Gruen, an elderly maid of all
work who had been with them for many years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The responsibility of the household might
have weighed heavily upon Nancy, but she was
the type of girl who is capable of accomplishing
a great many things in a comparatively
short length of time. She enjoyed sports of all
kinds and she found time for clubs and parties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In school Nancy had been very popular and
she boasted many friends. People declared
that she had a way of taking life very seriously
without impressing one as being the least bit
serious herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While at school Nancy had made one particular
chum, Helen Corning, of whom we
shall hear more later. She had also made two
enemies, the Topham sisters. Once she had
caught Ada in wrongdoing in class and both
sisters had placed the blame on Nancy. But
Helen and two others had come to Nancy’s
rescue. Since that time Ada and Isabel had
been more hateful to Nancy than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not be back for luncheon to-day,” Nancy
told Hannah, as she prepared to leave the
house. “I have made out the dinner menu and
ordered the groceries, so I guess you won’t
need me for a few hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the house, she went to the garage
where she kept her automobile. It was a shining
new blue roadster, the birthday gift of her
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly backing the automobile to the street,
she set off for the shopping district. She drove
swiftly down the boulevard, and upon reaching
the more congested streets, wormed her way
skillfully through heavy traffic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entering a department store, she made a
number of small purchases on the main floor
and then went directly to the wearing apparel
section, as it was her intention to purchase a
frock suitable for the afternoon party to which
she had been invited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Usually, Nancy found the service excellent,
but this morning was an especially busy one and
an extra rush of customers had temporarily
overwhelmed the sales force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not mind waiting her turn, but
quietly sat down in a convenient chair and
glanced about with interest. After a time her
attention was attracted toward two girls who,
like herself, were waiting for an available saleswoman,
but less patiently. Instantly, Nancy
recognized them as Ada and Isabel Topham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were remonstrating with the floor manager,
and their voices carried so far that she
could not help hearing what they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been standing here nearly ten minutes!”
Ada said petulantly. “Send a saleswoman
to us immediately!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I can’t,” the floor manager
said regretfully. “There are a number of
others ahead of you. An extra rush of customers——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you don’t know who we are!”
Ada interrupted rudely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, I do,” the floor manager told her,
with a trace of weariness. “I will have a saleswoman
here in a few moments. If you will
only wait——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not accustomed to waiting,” Isabel
Topham told him icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such service!” Ada chimed in. “Do you
realize that my father owns stock in this store?
If we report your conduct to him, he could
have you discharged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” the harassed floor manager
apologized. “But it is a rule of the store.
You must await your turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ada tossed her head and her dark eyes flashed
angrily. In spite of the expensive clothes she
wore, she was anything but attractive, for she
was tall and slender to the point of being
termed “skinny.” Now that her face was distorted
with anger, she was positively ugly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel, who was the pride of the Topham
family, was rather pretty in a vapid sort of
way, but Nancy Drew thought that her face
lacked character. She had acquired an artificial
manner of speaking which was both irritating
and amusing. It was her mother’s
ambition that some day she marry into a
wealthy family, and every opportunity was
given her for a brilliant match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two sisters were older than Nancy, but
had been in her class at school. She had found
them stupid, as well as arrogant. They had
never been popular with their classmates and
had boasted few friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as they turned from the floor manager
and saw her for the first time, Nancy bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel coldly returned the bow but did not
speak a word of greeting. Ada gave no indication
that she had even noticed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Snobs!” Nancy told herself. “The next
time I won’t even bother to speak to them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment a saleswoman hurried toward
the Topham girls and at once they began to
shower abuse upon her for her failure to wait
upon them sooner. Nancy watched them curiously
as they examined the gowns which the
saleswoman brought out for their approval.
Evidently, Isabel and Ada were in an unpleasant
frame of mind, for they tossed aside beautiful
creations of lace and chiffon with scarcely
a second glance. They found fault with everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very chic gown,” the saleswoman told
them hopefully, as she displayed an attractive
dress. “It is a Paris model and arrived this
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ada picked it up, gave it one careless glance,
and then tossed it into a chair. The gown
slipped to the floor in a crumpled mass, and,
to the horror of the saleswoman, Ada stepped
on it as she turned to examine another dress.
In disgust, Nancy moved away and began to
examine a rack of dresses in another part
of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, as she wandered back, she saw
that Ada and Isabel were leaving without having
made a purchase. As they swept past, Ada
brushed against her. Instead of apologizing,
she wheeled and surveyed Nancy coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do watch where you are going!” she said
tartly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy stifled a sharp retort and made no
reply. Not without amusement she watched
the Topham sisters as they flounced to the
elevator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wonder that people say such mean
things about them,” Nancy told herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her thoughts were cut short as a saleswoman
offered her services. It was the same girl who
had waited upon the Topham sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy quickly selected a party frock of blue
crepe which matched her eyes, and went to the
fitting room to try it on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a real pleasure to serve you, Miss
Drew,” the saleswoman assured her when they
were alone. “But how I dread to see the Topham
sisters come into the store! They are so
unreasonable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ada and Isabel aren’t very popular,”
Nancy agreed. “They seem to think their
word is law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The saleswoman sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m afraid it will be if they get all
of Josiah Crowley’s money.” She lowered
her voice. “The estate hasn’t been settled, but
they’re counting on the fortune already. I
heard Miss Ada say to her sister: ‘Oh, I guess
we’ll get all of old Crowley’s fortune as soon
as the lawyers stop squabbling.’ But it’s my
opinion the Tophams are mightily worried for
fear somebody will show up with a later
will which may do them out of most of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy was far too wise to engage in gossip
with the saleswoman, for she could not tell how
far anything she might say would be carried.
But she was interested in the information. The
fact that the Tophams were worried indicated
to her that they were of the opinion that Josiah
Crowley had made a second will. Evidently,
they were somewhat disturbed by the claims of
the other relatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ordering the frock which she had purchased
sent to her home, Nancy glanced at her watch
and saw that it was after twelve o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must hurry or I’ll be late in meeting
father,” she thought, and left the store.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drove directly to her father’s office, and
although a few minutes ahead of the appointed
time, found that he was ready to leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What luck, father?” Nancy demanded eagerly,
when they were alone in the inner office.
“Did Mr. Rolsted promise to take luncheon
with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. We are to meet him at the Royal
Hotel in ten minutes. Do you still think I
should quiz him about the Crowley will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m more than ever interested in the
case, father. I can’t tell you why, but I just
seem to know that Josiah Crowley made a
second will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your intuitions are frequently correct,
Nancy,” Mr. Drew smiled. “So I’ll do
my best to find out what Mr. Rolsted knows
about the case. However, I must warn you not
to appear too eager for information, or he
may suspect we have a dark motive behind
the luncheon invitation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be careful,” Nancy laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Royal Hotel was located less than a
block away, and Nancy and her father quickly
walked the distance. As they entered the
lobby they found Mr. Rolsted there ahead of
them. Carson Drew introduced his daughter,
and the three made their way to the dining
room where a table had been reserved for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the conversation centered about a
variety of subjects. As the luncheon progressed
the two lawyers began to talk enthusiastically
of their college days together and finally of
their profession. Nancy began to fear that the
subject of the Crowley estate never would be
brought up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, over the coffee cups, Carson Drew
skillfully swung the conversation into a new
channel and began to discuss strange cases
which had fallen into his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, I haven’t heard the details of
the Crowley case. How are the Tophams making
out? I understand the relatives are trying
to break the will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Mr. Rolsted remained silent,
and Nancy began to think that he did not intend
to enter into a discussion of the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The case wasn’t turned over to me, Carson,”
the lawyer said quietly. “But I confess
I’ve followed it rather closely because of a
special interest I happen to have in Crowley.
As the present will stands, I do not believe it
can be broken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the Tophams will get the entire estate,”
Mr. Drew commented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, unless another will is uncovered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another will?” Carson Drew inquired innocently.
“Then you believe Crowley made
a second one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rolsted hesitated as though uncertain
whether or not he should divulge additional
information, and then with a quick glance
about, lowered his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, I wouldn’t want this to get out,”
he began doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may trust Nancy not to repeat,” Mr.
Drew observed, guessing what was in the lawyer’s
mind. “I’ve found that out by experience,”
and Carson Drew smiled upon his
daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I will say this much—it would not
surprise me if another will should come to
light. The Tophams treated Crowley most unkindly
after he had made his will in their favor.
About a year ago Crowley came to my office
and told me that he wanted to draw up a new
will. He indicated that he intended to cut the
Tophams off without a cent. He expressed a
desire to write the will himself, and asked me
a number of questions. I told him exactly how
to proceed. When he left my office he promised
that he would have me look over the document
when he had drawn it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you actually saw the will?” Mr. Drew
asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, strange to say, Crowley never came
back. I don’t know whether he drew up the
will or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if he did, there would be an excellent
chance that it would not be legal I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s a real trick to draw up a will that
cannot be broken. But Josiah Crowley was a
very careful man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, if he left even a loophole, the Tophams
would drag the matter into court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is a foregone conclusion that the
Tophams will keep the fortune whether they
have a right to it or not. They have the advantage
of money, you know. I believe the
other relatives have filed a claim, but they
have no proof a second will exists, and without
money they cannot hope to fight the Tophams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While her father and Mr. Rolsted discussed
the case, Nancy Drew remained silent, but not
a word of what was said escaped her. Although
she gave no indication of her feelings, the
information excited her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time, Mr. Drew paid the luncheon
check and the three arose and left the dining
room. Mr. Rolsted took leave of them in the
lobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Nancy, did you find out what you
wanted to know?” Carson Drew inquired after
the lawyer had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, father, it’s just as I suspected! Mr.
Crowley did make a second will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t jump hastily at conclusions,”
Mr. Drew warned her. “It’s possible that
Crowley never drew up the will at all, or if he
did, he may have destroyed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s possible, of course. But he had no
love for the Tophams, and I have a feeling he
hid the will someplace. Oh, if only I could
find it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be as easy as looking for a needle
in a haystack,” Mr. Drew replied. “If I were
you, I would forget about the case, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t forget about it until I’ve at least
made an attempt to find out what became of
that will,” Nancy insisted stubbornly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, dig into the mystery if you like,
but I’m afraid you’ve set yourself an impossible
task. I don’t see how you hope to discover
what became of the will when you haven’t
even a clue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll find a way!” Nancy laughed. “Give
me time and I’ll surprise you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But after she had said good-bye to her father
and was slowly driving toward home, doubt
assailed her. She knew that the odds were
against her. Although she was determined
to find out what had become of the Crowley
will, she was at a loss to know how to begin.
As her father had reminded her, she did not
have a single clue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Where there’s a will, there’s a way,’ ”
she quoted whimsically. “That old proverb
is doubly true in the Crowley case. If there
actually is a second will, I’m going to find it!
And if I do, I hope it won’t prove to be in
the Tophams’ favor!”</p>
