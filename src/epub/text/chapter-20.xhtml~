			<h1>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>What Nancy Found</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>While Nancy Drew hesitated, uncertain
which way to turn, her mind worked more
clearly than ever before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She realized instantly that she could not
hope to run to the front of the car and place
the keys under the seat where she had found
them. Instead of attempting the impossible,
she flung them upon the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then glancing frantically about for a hiding
place, she saw an empty manger. Running to
it, she scrambled inside and dropped the
blanket over her head just as one of the barn
doors swung open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three men came in, closing the door after
them, and, as Nancy had suspected, they were
the robbers. Evidently, they had been drinking,
for they were quarreling among themselves
over the division of spoils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aw, shut up,” the leader growled. “Get
in and let’s be getting out of here before we
have the cops down on our heads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy heard him rummaging under the seat
of the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, what did you do with them keys?” he
demanded harshly of one of his men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you suppose?” came the unpleasant
response. “I put ’em under the seat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then come and find them, and don’t be all
day about it, either!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Get out of the way and give me
a chance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the second robber went to the truck and
began a careful search for the keys, Nancy
Drew crouched fearfully in her hiding place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see what could have happened to
them keys,” the robber complained after an
unsuccessful search. “I put ’em right under
this seat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, if you’ve lost ’em—” the leader did
not finish the threat, for at that moment the
third robber stooped over and picked up something
at his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here they are on the floor! You must have
put ’em in your pocket and dropped ’em out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t!” the other retorted. “I never
had them keys in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The robbers were in a quarrelsome mood and
would have engaged in a battle then and there
had not the leader interposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, cut out the comedy! We ain’t got no
time for a fight unless we want to land behind
the bars!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if we do, it will be your fault! You
left that girl to starve—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up!” the leader snarled. He rattled
the rear door of the van and found it locked.
“There’s no harm done this time. No one has
meddled with the truck. Now get in before I
give you a swift kick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a few more angry words, the three
robbers climbed into the front seat and started
the engine. Due to their inebriated condition
they had overlooked the barn doors, and before
the van could be backed from the building,
it was necessary for one of the men to get
out and fasten them back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In relief Nancy watched the men go. The
moment they were a safe distance from the
barn, she scrambled out of the manger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused long enough to make certain that
the van had taken the road to Garwin. Then,
clutching the precious clock in her arms, she
turned and ran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy darted into the woods, she cast
an anxious glance over her shoulder, but to
her intense relief she saw that she was not
being followed. There was no one to be seen
in the vicinity of the roadhouse, and the big
moving van was proceeding slowly on its way
toward Garwin, the occupants oblivious that
their whereabouts had been discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a narrow escape that time,” Nancy
told herself as she ran. “I hate to think of my
fate if I had been discovered.” She chuckled
softly at her own bravado and clutched the
mantel clock more tightly in her arms. “Oh,
well, it was worth the risk I took!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dark in the woods and Nancy could
see only a few feet ahead of her. To her chagrin
she discovered that she had left her automobile
flashlight somewhere in the barn, probably
in the manger. There was no time to go
back after it. Confident that her sense of direction
was good, she plunged through the
bushes toward the place where she had parked
her roadster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure the clock is the right one,” she
thought. “Now, if it only contains Josiah
Crowley’s notebook!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the timber there was insufficient light for
her to examine the clock, but from the hasty
glance she had given it in the barn, she was
almost certain it was the timepiece Abigail
Rowen had described to her. If the old woman’s
story was correct, she would find Josiah
Crowley’s notebook inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reaching the roadster and finding it exactly
as she had left it, the girl sprang inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go for the police as fast as I can and
send them after the robbers,” she decided.
“The Tophams don’t deserve any consideration,
but I couldn’t be mean enough to sit
quietly by and let them lose their household
goods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as she was about to start the motor,
her glance fell upon the Crowley clock which
she had placed on the seat beside her. She
was fairly overcome with curiosity to learn
what it would reveal. As she hesitated, she
found it impossible to resist the temptation of
investigating it immediately, even at the cost
of a few minutes delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impulsively, she opened the glass door and
ran her hand around the walls. There was
nothing inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone!” Nancy groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could it be that the Tophams had discovered
the notebook only to destroy it? Nancy discarded
the thought as quickly as it came to
mind, for she recalled the conversation she had
overheard between Ada and Isabel. No, they
were as ignorant as herself concerning the
location of the will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was more likely that Abigail Rowen had
been confused in her story. After all, she had
not declared that the notebook would be found
inside the clock. Nancy had made the deduction
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was almost certain I’d find the notebook,”
she murmured in disappointment. “It
must be here somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning the clock upside down, she gave it a
hard shake. Something rattled. Hopefully,
she repeated the action. Unquestionably, there
was something bulky inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be the notebook!” Nancy thought
in excitement. “Unless I’m wrong, it’s behind
the face! How can I get it off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a vain attempt to remove the heavy
cardboard face with her fingers, she lifted the
automobile seat and found a small tool with
which she could pry. It then required but an
instant to remove the two hands of the clock
and jerk off the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the cardboard fell to the floor, Nancy
peered hopefully inside and gave a low cry of
delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eureka!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, at one side of the clock, attached to a
hook in the top, dangled a tiny blue notebook!</p>
