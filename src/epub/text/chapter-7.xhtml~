			<h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Nancy Turns Sleuth</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>While Nancy Drew eagerly waited, scarcely
daring to breathe naturally lest her presence
be detected, Ada began to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if there should happen to be another
will, we may be dumped,” she said sourly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe Josiah Crowley ever made
such a will,” Isabel replied, in so low a tone
that Nancy scarcely caught the words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Evidently Nancy Drew does, or she
wouldn’t be taking such an interest in those
Horner girls,” Ada returned. “I know she had
them at her house last week, because I was
passing and saw them go in. How I hate that
girl! If she should get her father interested,
he might dig up another will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even if another will does turn up, we can
trust dad to take care of it,” Isabel commented
dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean he would——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind what I mean,” Isabel insinuated
darkly. “Mother and dad wouldn’t be
simple enough to let that money get away from
us. It’s ours by right, anyhow. Didn’t Josiah
Crowley live on us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we ought to have all of the money
after enduring him for nearly three years.
Just the same, I don’t like the way Nancy
Drew has taken up with the Horner girls. She
always did have a way of nosing into things
she had no business to find out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, pooh for her,” Isabel scoffed. “Let
her try to discover anything she likes. The
money was given to us fairly enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation ended abruptly as Isabel
and Ada arose from the bench and walked on
down the street. Nancy waited until they were
out of sight and then emerged from the bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There may be a chance to find that missing
will after all,” she reasoned, as she sank down
on the bench vacated by Isabel and Ada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy had always been convinced that Josiah
Crowley had made a second will. However,
since her talk with the Horner girls, she had
shared her father’s opinion that the document
had fallen into the hands of the Tophams only
to be destroyed. This conviction had discouraged
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the information which she had gleaned
from the snatch of overhead conversation,
gave her new hope. From what Isabel and Ada
had said, she was led to believe that if Josiah
Crowley had made a second will, the Tophams
were as ignorant as herself concerning its
whereabouts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway, it’s encouraging to know the will
hasn’t been destroyed,” Nancy told herself.
“But there’s one thing certain. If the Tophams
ever get their hands on it, they’ll take
care it never comes to light. From what Isabel
and Ada said I judge they’re beginning to
realize their position is anything but secure.
If I’m ever to find that will, I must get busy
before they beat me to it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy Drew possessed her father’s liking
for a mystery, and she delighted in a battle of
wits when championing a worthy cause. Carson
Drew had often remarked that he enjoyed
the detective work of his cases better than the
court work, but Nancy knew he was too busy
with his own cases to devote much attention
to the missing Crowley will. If anything were
done to help the Horner girls win their inheritance,
she must accomplish it herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy reviewed the facts of the case, it
seemed to her that she must have overlooked a
possible clue. Never had a mystery appeared
more baffling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For nearly ten minutes Nancy sat lost in
deep thought. Then, with a cry of delight she
sprang to her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How stupid of me not to think of it before!
The Horner girls aren’t the only ones who
should have figured in the will. There were a
number of relatives, and father said that they
filed a claim, too. I wonder who they are. If
I could talk with them, it’s possible I might
learn something that would have a bearing on
the case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Convinced that the inspiration was a happy
one, she set off toward her father’s office. He
was engaged in an important conference when
she arrived, and Nancy was forced to wait ten
minutes before she was admitted to the inner
office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what?” her father asked, smiling as
she burst in upon him. “Is it a new dress you
want!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s cheeks were flushed and her eyes
danced with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t try to tease me,” she protested.
“I’ve stumbled onto something important, and
I want information!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At your service, Nancy,” Mr. Drew said.
“But if it’s about that Crowley case, I’ve told
you everything I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy poured out the story of her encounter
with the Topham sisters in the department
store and told of the conversation she had overheard
in the public park. Mr. Drew listened
with interest until she had finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now what is it you want?” he asked
gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought if I went to those other relatives
I might be able to learn something which may
help solve the mystery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good idea, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t know their names, and that’s
why I came to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could help you, but I’m afraid I
can’t,” Mr. Drew said regretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s face fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute!” he called, as she turned to
leave. “I can’t supply the names you want,
but I think I can tell you where to find them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the courthouse. They should be on file.”
He glanced at his watch and frowned. “But
I’m afraid it is too late to go there this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, and I’m anxious to find out right
away,” Nancy declared in disappointment.
“If I delay even a single day the Tophams
may get ahead of me and find that will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly her face brightened as she thought
of something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know! I’ll jump into the roadster and
run out and have a talk with the Horner girls.
They should be able to furnish me the information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can try them, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what I’ll do,” Nancy decided,
as she turned again toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute,” Carson Drew stopped her.
“I wonder if you realize just what you are
getting into, Nancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only this. Detective work isn’t always
the safest occupation in which to engage. I
happen to know that Richard Topham is an
unpleasant man when crossed. If you actually
succeed in learning anything which may help
the Horner girls, you are certain to have the
Tophams in your wool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not afraid of them, father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” Mr. Drew exclaimed. “I was
hoping you would say that. I’m glad you have
the courage of your convictions, but I didn’t
want you to march off into battle without a
knowledge of what, undoubtedly, you will be up
against.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Battle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, battle. Rest assured the Tophams
won’t give up the fortune without a bitter
struggle. However, if they attempt to make
serious trouble, I promise to deal with them
myself. I only wish I had the time to help
you find the will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I find it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take the matter into court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you! There’s no one like you in
all the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy moved toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may not get back until rather late,” she
threw back over her shoulder. “I have a feeling
I may discover a real clue to-day, and if I
do, I’m going to trail it down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With characteristic impetuosity, she darted
from the room, permitting the office door to
bang behind her.</p>
