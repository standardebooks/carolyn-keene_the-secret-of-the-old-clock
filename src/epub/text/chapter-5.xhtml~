			<h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A Conference</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Although the rain was no longer falling,
the River Road was a sea of mud, and before
Nancy Drew started for home, the Horner girls
insisted on helping her put chains on the rear
wheels of the roadster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll never make it to the gravel unless
you do,” Grace advised her. “The River Road
is terribly slippery in wet weather. You’re
sure you want to attempt it? We’d love to
have you stay with us until to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll have only two miles to go before
I strike gravel,” Nancy returned. “I’ll make
it all right. But before I go I do wish you
would let me pay for all the trouble I have
caused you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We couldn’t think of accepting money,”
Grace said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s been fun having you here,” Allie added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, after thanking the Horner sisters
for their hospitality, Nancy told them good-bye.
Allie and Grace watched her until she
had backed the Roadster from the barn and
was safely on the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re taking a big chance in this mud,”
called out Allie after her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you have any trouble, come back here,”
added Grace. “That is, if you can get back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t skid into a tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or into a ditch—that would be worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you trying to do, make me nervous?”
demanded Nancy, but with a smile on
her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; we only want to see you get home
safely,” answered Grace, and by that time the
car was so far on its way no more could be said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once on her way Nancy had little trouble,
for she was a skillful driver. The mud was
heavy, but although the roadster slipped about
she managed to keep it in the road. Nevertheless,
she was relieved when at last she reached
the main graveled highway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll stop at father’s office,” she decided, as
she drove into River Heights. “I want to tell
him about my adventure right away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She parked the car and surveyed it rather
ruefully as she climbed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor thing needs a bath! But even if I
did get into mud, it was worth it. Otherwise
I would never have found out about the Horner
girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Nancy was admitted to her father’s private
office, he arose from his chair to greet her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you’re here safe and sound,” he
declared, in relief. “I’ve been worried ever
since that storm came up. I telephoned the
house and Hannah said you weren’t back. It
gave me a bad scare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a little adventure,” Nancy announced,
with an important air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quickly, she told of her meeting with the
Horner sisters and what she had learned concerning
the Crowley will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allie and Grace Horner are as poor as
church mice, but they’re proud, too,” Nancy
ended. “If only we could do something to
help them! They deserve a portion of the
Crowley estate, but they’ll never get it unless
someone takes a hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From what you say it looks as though Crowley
really did make a will in their favor,” Carson
Drew commented thoughtfully. “I never
had any particular liking for Richard Topham,
and I’ll admit it would please me to see him
lose the money. I’ll be glad to do anything I
can to help the Horner girls, Nancy. We
might invite them to the house for a little conference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was hoping you would suggest that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say the girls have no idea what became
of the will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They never saw it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is possible that by talking with them
we may learn something which may serve as
a clue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll invite them to the house to-morrow if
you want me to,” Nancy said quickly. “You’re
so clever at asking questions, and the Horner
girls will do anything in their power to help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Drew studied his desk calendar for a
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. But make it day after to-morrow
afternoon at three. I have no appointment
for that hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that she had accomplished her purpose,
Nancy gave her father a hug and fairly danced
toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you’d try to help them,” she called
back over her shoulder. “Now that you’ve
promised, I’ll scamper off and let you get your
work done!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s interest in the Crowley case had
intensified since her chance meeting with the
Horner girls, and it was with impatience that
she awaited the conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the day of the appointment she kept
watching the clock, wondering if Allie and
Grace would keep the engagement. She had
sent them the invitation and they had promised
to come, but Nancy was a trifle uneasy, especially
as the hour of three approached and the
two girls had not arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why they don’t come,” she
fretted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were scarcely out of her mouth
when the doorbell jangled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That must be the girls now,” she cried, as
she hurried to open the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was indeed Allie and Grace Horner.
Nancy greeted them enthusiastically and, ushering
them into the comfortable study, introduced
her father. At first the Horner sisters
were rather ill at ease, but after a few minutes
they relaxed and began to talk frankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about Josiah Crowley,” Carson
Drew suggested. “I understand that he was
rather a peculiar man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he was,” Allie began impulsively.
“I’ve seen him go about hunting for his spectacles
when they were on his nose all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he ever hide things?” Mr. Drew inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he?” Allie laughed. “He was always
putting things away in what he called a safe
place. The place was usually so safe that he
could never find it again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he ever say anything which would lead
you to believe that he had hidden a will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Allie shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that I can remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he did, too!” Grace broke in. “One
day when he was at our house he got to talking
about the Tophams and the way they were
trying to get his money. ‘I guess they’ll be
fooled all right when they find out I’ve made
another will,’ he said with that odd little
chuckle of his. ‘This time I’m not going to
trust it to any lawyer. I’ll put it away in a
place that I know will be safe.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” Allie agreed. “I had forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was Crowley living with the Tophams at
the time he told you this?” Carson Drew asked
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it possible that he hid the
will somewhere in the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean at the Tophams?” Grace inquired.
“Of course I have no way of knowing,
but it’s my opinion that he did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy and her father exchanged quick
glances as the same thought occurred to them.
Perhaps the Tophams had discovered the will
and already had destroyed it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew asked a few more questions.
The Horner girls were eager to help, but they
were unable to furnish additional information
which had a direct bearing on the missing will.
After Nancy had served tea, they thanked Carson
Drew for his interest in them, and arose
to depart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I find that I am able to help you in any
way, I will do so,” Mr. Drew told the sisters
as he escorted them to the door. “And of
course there will be no charge for my services.
However, unless the will is found there is really
very little that can be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Allie and Grace had left, Nancy turned
inquiring eyes upon her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charming girls,” he commented, “and undoubtedly
deserving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll help them?” Nancy demanded
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid there is nothing I can do,
Nancy,” Mr. Drew returned regretfully. “The
will is probably lost forever. It wouldn’t surprise
me if it had been destroyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean—the Tophams?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carson Drew nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same thought came to me,” Nancy declared.
“It would be just like them to destroy
it if it fell into their hands! They have no
scruples whatsoever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course we have no proof the Tophams
did away with the will, Nancy. It would be
very unwise to suggest such a thing to the Horner
girls. They deserve a portion of the estate,
but without the will nothing can be done. If
they took the matter to court they wouldn’t
have a chance to win.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you’re right,” Nancy admitted
unwillingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while she dropped the subject for the
time being, Nancy Drew did not forget the Horner
sisters. She continued to hope that by
some queer twist of fate they would come into
their rightful inheritance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the will has been destroyed I don’t see
how anyone can help them,” she told herself
rather unhappily. “But until I’m sure of it,
I’m not going to give up!” She squared her
shoulders with determination. “I’ll find some
way to discover what became of the will!”</p>
