			<h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>An Unpleasant Encounter</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of Nancy Drew’s firm decision to
assist the Horner girls, the days slipped by
and, try as she would, she could think of no
way to discover whether or not the missing
Crowley will had fallen into the hands of the
Tophams. Although she seldom discussed the
case with her father, he knew that she was
troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re worrying about the Horner girls,”
he observed one day. “I am afraid you are
taking their misfortunes too seriously. There
is nothing you can do without the will, and you
had best forget about it. Why, you’ve scarcely
been out of the house since the Horner girls
were here. Go shopping, or anything, to take
your mind from the subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been thinking about Allie and
Grace,” Nancy admitted, with a rueful smile.
“I was so sure I could do something for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give your mind a rest and perhaps you’ll
have an inspiration,” Mr. Drew encouraged
her kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll take your advice and go
shopping, though I really haven’t a thing to
buy. The fresh air will do me good, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After luncheon, Nancy left the house and
made her way toward the business section of
River Heights. The walk was a long one, but
she took it at a brisk pace. Nancy naturally
was athletic, and as she swung along more
than one passerby turned to look after her in
admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After “window shopping” for a time, she
wandered into a department store more from
curiosity than because she had anything to
buy. She moved about aimlessly, gazing at
whatever struck her fancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Nancy’s attention centered upon
two girls who were hurrying down the aisle
ahead of her. She stopped short and stared.
Though their backs were turned, she had recognized
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ada and Isabel Topham! I’m sure I don’t
want to tag them around! I’ll just slip down
another aisle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nancy Drew never carried the thought
into action, for at that very moment she saw
Ada brush carelessly against a counter of expensive
vases. As her sleeve caught, a large
fragile bowl was swept to the floor. In horror
Nancy heard the crash and saw the bowl break
into a dozen pieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Ada looked down upon the wreckage, a
slight flush mounted to her cheeks. Then with
a toss of her head, she started to move on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss, I am afraid I must ask you to pay
for the bowl,” a saleswoman interposed politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ada wheeled angrily and stared at the saleswoman
insolently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not pay for it!” she snapped. “I
didn’t break it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Miss, I saw you knock it off the counter,”
the saleswoman protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the floor manager had arrived
upon the scene, and a number of shoppers had
gathered about Ada and the salesgirl. Nancy
likewise drew closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This impudent girl claims I broke a vase,”
Ada stormed, addressing the floor manager.
“I wasn’t even near the counter at the time!
However, I did see her knock it to the floor
herself. Isn’t that so, Isabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Solemnly, Isabel agreed to the untruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The floor manager looked doubtfully from
the Topham sisters to the saleswoman. He
realized that it would be a serious error to
accuse well-to-do customers falsely, and for
that reason he was inclined to give the Topham
girls the benefit of the doubt. He stooped
over and examined the fragments of the bowl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Someone must pay for the damage,” he
said severely. “This is an expensive imported
bowl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let your clerk pay for it out of her
salary,” Ada retorted. “If she hadn’t been so
stupid she wouldn’t have broken the vase!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The saleswoman was too bewildered to take
her own part and Nancy saw that the floor
manager was in a dilemma. As she sensed
that he was about to exonerate Ada from all
blame, she stepped forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be mistaken, Miss Topham,” she
said quietly. “I am certain the saleswoman
did not break the bowl, for I saw the accident
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What business have you to interfere?” Ada
demanded harshly, wheeling upon Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it isn’t my business, but I can’t
permit you to accuse this girl of something
she didn’t do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw the accident, Miss?” the floor
manager questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. As Miss Topham walked by the counter,
her sleeve caught on the vase.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t true,” Ada snapped. “But I’m
tired of this silly argument. How much do
you want for your vase?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The floor manager studied a price list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” Ada fairly screamed. “You want
fifty dollars for that old bowl? I’ll never
pay it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The vase was imported from Italy, Miss,
and I am afraid you must pay the price asked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know who I am?” Ada inquired
loftily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think everyone in the city knows about
the Richard Tophams,” the floor manager returned
wearily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father owns——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t own this store,” the man interrupted,
with growing impatience. “If you
refuse to pay for the vase I shall be forced
to turn you over to the authorities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t dare!” Ada gasped. “Never
in all my life have I been insulted like this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isabel, who was slightly more reasonable
than her sister, now held a whispered conference
with Ada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, I’ll pay for the bowl,” Ada decided,
as she took out her checkbook. “But
let me warn you the matter won’t be dropped
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned upon Nancy Drew and eyed her
coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not through with you either, young
lady! You’ll pay for this outrage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy made no reply but continued to smile
pleasantly, an act which further enraged the
Topham sisters. Hastily settling for the damage
Ada had done, they sailed grandly out
of the store.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gratefully, the saleswoman thanked Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know how I appreciated the way
you took my part. I couldn’t have paid for
the bowl, and if you hadn’t said what you did
the floor manager probably would have discharged
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw her break the bowl and I was determined
to see justice done. There is my
name and address—if you need it,” and Nancy
handed the woman her card.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid you have made enemies by taking
my part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shrugged her shoulders indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It really doesn’t matter. The Topham girls
were never my friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they may try to get even with you.
They’re very spiteful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them try!” Nancy smiled. “However,
I don’t believe there is any need to worry.
Their talk is mostly bluff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lightly, Nancy Drew dismissed the subject,
and, as she found she was being regarded with
curiosity and admiration by those who had
witnessed the scene, left the store. She walked
slowly toward the park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It makes my blood fairly boil every time I
think of Ada and Isabel Topham getting all of
the Crowley fortune,” she told herself, with
feeling. “Especially when Grace and Allie
Horner need the money so badly. The way
Ada tried to accuse that shopgirl was disgusting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy crossed the public park and paused
for a moment at the drinking fountain. As
she glanced up she saw that unwittingly she
had selected the path Isabel and Ada Topham
had taken. Upon leaving the department store
they, too, had gone to the park and were now
seated upon a bench engaged in earnest conversation.
Their heads were close together,
and, from the expression on their faces, Nancy
suspected that they were discussing her. Unless
she retraced her steps it would be necessary
to pass directly in front of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they see me they are certain to say something
mean,” Nancy thought, “and if they do
I’ll be sure to lose my temper. I know!” she
decided impulsively. “I’ll take the path
through the bushes and avoid them. I can pass
behind that bench and they’ll never notice me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ada and Isabel were so engrossed in their
conversation that they failed to notice Nancy’s
approach. Chuckling to herself, Nancy left
the sidewalk and quietly made her way down
the path which was shaded with overhanging
bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had no intention of attempting to overhear
what the Topham sisters were saying, but
as she noiselessly approached the bench where
they were sitting, two words reached her ears,
causing her to pause involuntarily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ada was speaking, and the phrase which
Nancy had accidently overheard was “the
will.” In a flash, her suspicions were aroused.
She comprehended the significance of the
phrase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be Josiah Crowley’s will they’re
talking about,” she reasoned. “Perhaps they
know something about the missing will! They
may reveal what became of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the instinct of a detective, Nancy Drew
crept cautiously closer. The bushes were thick,
and by crouching low behind the bench she was
able to hear without being seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, if only she might learn something which
would prove that the Tophams had deprived
the Horner girls of their inheritance!</p>
